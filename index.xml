</div>
<p>When I created this blog I was ready to explore many diverse topics. I have been thinking for quite some time about creating this kind of 2025 movie recap… Except it won’t really be a movie recap.</p>
<p>I like movies.</p>
<p>I chose one of my favorite movies as my first watch this year. If you’ve read my previous <a href="../../posts/quintic">shamefully half-<del>in</del>complete post</a>, you might have recognized it. I’m laughing while writing this because I can’t imagine myself as one of those popular bloggers constantly cross-referencing their own posts. I’ll strive to keep this blog alive for many years so one day I get to self-reference this self-reference and start laughing at it again. I can’t explain why, but <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/only-yesterday/"><em>Only yesterday</em></a> is definitely my thing. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/millennium-actress/">A</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/memoir-of-a-snail/">woman</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/aftersun/3/">trying</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/creatura-2023/">to</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/summer-1993/1/">reflect</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/alcarras/">on</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/1/">her</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/flores-para-antonio/">childhood</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/sentimental-value-2025/">memories</a>? You’ll find more of that in my 2025. For me, this movie would mark the start of a year brimming with emotions.</p>

</div>
<p>I warned you. We’re not here to analyze movies.</p>
<p>I try to put a lot of effort into every post, but this one might be a bit different. Don’t expect too much coherence. You should read this as a labyrinthine, natural, intimate peep into my little… mind camera.</p>
<section id="you-cant-rate-your-feelings" class="level1">
<h1>You can’t rate your feelings</h1>
<p>Come to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/sing-sing-2023/"><em>Sing Sing</em></a>. As much as I’d like this to be a musical (I think <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/wicked-for-good/">I’m starting to love musicals!</a>), it’s just the title of a drama, but what a drama. It was only my third watch of the year, but it definitely made something click. It would change my perception of art for the rest of my <del>year</del> life. Sing Sing is just the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Sing">a prison</a>. The movie is based on a real story. Prisoners perform plays. And most of the actors play themselves! While watching this, I could only think that I was loving it, but it felt somewhat <em>cliché</em> (any <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shawshank-redemption/">prison drama</a> enjoyers out there?). It’s just that… I liked it. So who cares? Some things just can’t be explained. Promise I won’t need to use the word <em>cliché</em> again.</p>

</div>
<p>As you might have already guessed from the constant bombardment of movie links which, fear not, won’t stop throughout this post, I use <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)">letterboxing</a></del> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a>. I love adding the movies I see to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/diary/">my diary</a>, where I sometimes also add some comments, in Spanish because, after all, it’s <em>my</em> diary. You can also add a rating from 1 to 5. You see, even if you don’t use Letterboxd and were just to play this inoffensive rating game with some friends after leaving the theater, you’d inevitably shift your perspective. You’d become a cold-minded, analytical machine. <em>This scene was cool, but the script was something my dog could write. And this actor… What a shame</em>. Well, maybe you don’t relate to this. I did feel like that sometimes. If I have to rate a movie I see, I <em>need</em> to think along those lines. I feel the need to <em>judge</em>.</p>
<p>Enough of this crap. I just want to enjoy the movies. Since that day, I’ve never rated a movie again. I just add them to my diary and optionally hit a <em>like</em>. Not sure what <em>likes</em> mean for others, but I defined my own meaning for them. If I <em>like</em> a movie it means I’d watch it again. If I don’t hit a <em>like</em> I’ll most likely not rewatch it. I say <em>most likely</em> because it already failed a couple of times (<a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/1/"><em>Romería</em></a> I’m looking at you).</p>
<p>Since I stopped rating movies, I’ve achieved a sense of relief. I can now just <em>feel</em> them. You can’t rate your feelings.</p>
</section>
<section id="slow-down-slow-down" class="level1">
<h1>Slow down, slow down!</h1>
<p>Beauty lies in routine. That’s what some think (those <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/perfect-days-2023/">perfect days</a> come to mind). And we’ll have more to say about that. For me, the decision to watch a movie comes quite naturally. Especially after a long day of work or study, I might feel <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19770238/characters/nm13592008/?item=qt6568890&amp;ref_=ext_shr_lnk">like I’m sinking</a>. Then I just need to immerse myself in a movie. There’s nothing forced… Or that’s what I’d like to think.</p>
<p>Evil lies in routine. That’s another way to put it. I said my urge for movies is natural, so you wouldn’t be surprised when I say I was going to the cinema at least four times a week. Do experiences lose their charm when they become routine? That’s what I started pondering. Am I spoiling my experiences? Are my feelings not natural anymore?</p>
<p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/im-still-here-2024/">The last movie I watched in February</a> also made me reflect. I left the theater confused. I didn’t know if I just didn’t enjoy the movie as much, or if I was just not <em>in the mood</em>. That same week I had rewatched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/three-colours-blue/2/">one</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/three-colours-red/1/">two</a> of my favorite movies (I’m sorry <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/three-colours-white/">Karol Karol</a>). Maybe it was time to slow down…</p>
<div class="text-center">

</div>
<p>I decided to limit myself to one movie a week. I wanted to find out if I could get that charm back somehow (if I ever lost it in the first place). Incidentally, March would <em>screen</em> for me <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/evangelion-10-you-are-not-alone/">all</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/evangelion-20-you-can-not-advance/">four</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/evangelion-30-you-can-not-redo/"><em>Evangelion</em></a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time/">movies</a>, one each week. Unbelievable timing I’d say.</p>
<p>There was nothing too special about <em>Evangelion</em>. I’ve never quite been a fan. But anime has been important for me. In fact, anime was the reason I started watching movies! Anime clearly has a lot to say beyond kid shows and action-packed teenager-with-superpowers content. Of course I also started watching shows like <em>Dragon ball</em> and <em>Naruto</em>, and there’s also some nostalgia in them, but there’s much more waiting for you. If you’re curious, go take a look at <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/mushi-shi/">one</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/kinos-journey/">two</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/showa-genroku-rakugo-shinju/">three</a> that have a special meaning for me. As time passed, I would also watch <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/anne-of-green-gables-1979/">some</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-rose-of-versailles/">older</a> <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2402/Ashita_no_Joe">anime</a>, trying to trace back the timeline, wondering how things were in the past. But this had a limit. I wanted to learn more, I was curious about what people felt like when watching movies in the past. So I figured it was time to watch some classical movies… And somehow this is how I jumped straight into cinema. I still love finding <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/your-name/">some</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/">anime</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/howls-moving-castle/">movies</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/millennium-actress/">in</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/princess-mononoke/">the</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/spirited-away/1/">theaters</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/porco-rosso/">every</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind/">now</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/time-of-eve-the-movie/">and</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/ponyo/">then</a>, so I couldn’t say no to the <em>Evangelion</em> tetralogy.</p>
<p>Well, this is not an anime post, so I guess it’s time to move on. In April I was still trying to watch at most one movie a week, and in fact I really enjoyed <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/ghostlight-2024/">one of my favorites from the year</a>. It was a refreshing experience, but I also felt I was forcing myself too much. From May onwards, I would just go whenever I felt like going, no more constraints. I still fight with this “<em>Am I going too much?</em>” feeling from time to time, but in the end I just try to accept my movie thirst as a positive feeling.</p>

<section id="movies-are-not-everything" class="level1">
<h1>Movies are not everything</h1>
<p>I value experiences. It’s true, a movie can be an experience. But I started thinking whether this was the whole picture. Perhaps the experience I need is more like going to some place, releasing some emotion, and coming back. Does it sound strange? In practice, for me this meant starting to go more to other kinds of events like theater and music, not only cinema. And the feeling is proving not so different. Maybe movies are not everything…?</p>
<p>In that sense, this year I had some enlightening non-cinema experiences. You can’t imagine how good it felt to watch a… Talk? <a href="https://www.mataderomadrid.org/programacion/eclipse-0">Artistic representation of the history of masks</a>? Even the actor (or actress?!) was anonymous! I found the idea fascinating. If I ever get to finish writing a novel, you’re most likely not going to find my name on it. Oh, and music? Actually, I barely listen to music… Maybe it’s this “<em>routine is evil</em>” fear again. I encountered some of my favorite music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjUhXbGdLYo&amp;list=RDTjUhXbGdLYo">straight</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I&amp;list=RDa01QQZyl-_I">from</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fldIZJey1KA&amp;list=RDfldIZJey1KA">some</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o84y-5-cO0&amp;list=RD1o84y-5-cO0">movie</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1Ij_-mank&amp;list=RDTK1Ij_-mank">show</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KaPy9pijs&amp;list=RDj5KaPy9pijs">soundtrack</a>. I want to keep it as something special. Anyway, listening to live music is another experience. I really appreciated my workmates inviting me to a <a href="https://festivaldejazzmadrid.com/actividad/victor-wooten-the-wooten-brothers/">jazz concert</a> for my birthday. I couldn’t think of a better gift. It was so good that this idea of learning to play an instrument remained stuck in my mind since that day. Today I can say I’m at least trying! Speaking of concerts and another beautiful coincidence, while looking for the YouTube links above I found out <a href="https://valeria-castro.es/">Valeria Castro</a> is giving a concert in Madrid at the start of 2026. I met her thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fldIZJey1KA&amp;list=RDfldIZJey1KA">credits song</a> from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-47/2/"><em>El 47</em></a>, a Catalan movie I watched three times last year, the third one being my last watch of 2024. I’m listening to the song again while writing this… Of course I’m going to the concert.</p>

</div>
<p>I also wanted to extend this realization to my Letterboxd. To be honest, the main reason why I love Letterboxd is keeping my movie diary. I just log the movies I see there, also noting down the day and the theater (maybe even some <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/cinema-paradiso/">quite</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/1/">personal</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-life-of-chuck/">commentary</a>). Sometimes I just open my Letterboxd and scroll through my diary and remember all these good experiences… In fact, I’m doing this a lot while writing this post. I guess it’s my personal serotonin. Because of that, I decided I would just start logging <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/synecdoche-new-york/1/">some</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/concert-2013/2/">other</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/concert-2013/3/">events</a> I wanted to remember in the future. Who cares if the app is supposed to be only for movies? I don’t. If you read this, you like the idea and don’t have a Letterboxd account but watch even just one movie a month, I highly encourage you to join. Oh sweet memories…</p>
</section>
<section id="is-this-my-solo" class="level1">
<h1>Is this my solo…?</h1>
<p>A quick look at <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/diary/films/for/2025/">my 2025 diary</a> reminds me that, this year, about 85 of 133 experiences have been alone. No, I don’t write down the people I go with (maybe I should?), but I guess I’m not bad at remembering that. There are many conclusions one could draw from this. The easiest one would probably be that, after all, I don’t have many friends, and maybe even fewer of them would be willing to join me in these events. Another completely honest view is that I don’t want to be that annoying guy who is asking you every week if you want to go to the cinema, because, as you already know, I go <em>quite a lot</em>.</p>
<p>The most important conclusion (or rather a consequence of the others?) is that, in fact, I enjoy solitude. I’ve been talking to some friends about this, and it seems I’m not the only one who needs to be alone at times, but they’d rather do that in the intimacy of home. Personally, intimacy can just as well be a mental state, and I like the idea of going to these rooms full of people I don’t know who are there experiencing the same things as I am (perhaps like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/an-elephant-sitting-still/">certain people looking for an elephant in a distant city</a>). But this is just half of the picture, because I also like sitting in the first or second row, so that I have nobody in front of me and I get a stronger impression of being alone… I heard a random person sharing this reflection one day at the cinema. We might not be that different. It’s a weird mix I guess.</p>
<div class="text-center">

<p>The smell of silence <br> <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/27745-el-sur" class="attribution-link">[Image: Elías Querejeta P.C. / Criterion]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Overall, I think most of my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/sing-sing-2023/">best</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/el-sur/2/">experiences</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-exiles-2024/">going</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/bob-trevino-likes-it/">to</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/summer-1993/">the</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/cinema-paradiso/">cinema</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/sundays-2025/">happened</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-life-of-chuck/">alone</a>. This intimate setting makes it easier for me to let go of my emotions. But it’s not like I try to hide them when I go with others. At least I know it’s something I can’t control. But this is not always true! Can’t forget that <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-portuguese-house/1/">amazing cinema day I shared with seven workmates</a>. That will be hard to beat. In fact, I also realized I’ve never watched my favorite movie alone. I just like sharing it with others (if you still don’t know the movie, you have until the next section to make your guesses!). Someone told me this might be because I’m not prepared to face such strong emotions all by myself. I like to think that’s not the case. If the day comes then so be it. I’ll enjoy it to the fullest.</p>
<p>As I said, don’t be fooled by my misanthropic soliloquy. If you know me and want to go to the cinema together, you’ll make me happy. Just tell me!</p>
</section>
<section id="experience-through-repetition" class="level1">
<h1>Experience through repetition</h1>
<p>Beauty lies in routine. Yes, I’m repeating myself because this section is about repetition. Maybe repetition is the key.</p>
<p>The first time I watched <del><a href="https://letterboxd.com/agasthya/film/aftersun-2022/"><em>Aftersun</em></a> (<a href="https://letterboxd.com/trisfilms/film/aftersun-2022/">whoops wrong movie</a>)</del> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/aftersun/"><em>Aftersun</em></a>, I was far from imagining this would be my favorite movie. It was all by chance. I didn’t know about it and a friend told me we should go watch it. Surprisingly, this is the same person who introduced me to Letterboxd (thank you <a href="https://letterboxd.com/treefngrs/">Furtis</a>). Then again, in less than a month we went back to watch it with some other friends. I started to like it more, but it was still just a really good movie for me. It was only by the fourth time that I could finally say “<em>I have never felt something like this, it must be my favorite</em>”. And that just happened this year! I appreciate <em>Aftersun</em> now being basically a cult movie. That means I can find a theater screening it every few months. The fourth time I found out where the screening was thanks to an <a href="https://letterboxd.com/robertrouns/film/aftersun/2/">unknown Letterboxd user</a>. Yes, I like to stalk random people going to the same theaters as me (<em>Knock, knock, FBI here</em>). In fact, I already found the next screening for March next year. Can’t wait for that.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p><img src="https://lbm364dl.github.io/blog/assets/images/a-cinematic-year/aftersun.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600"></p>
<p>A perfectly imperfect copy <br> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19770238/mediaviewer/rm2026192641/" class="attribution-link">[Image: A24 / MUBI]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This isn’t my only supporting example for the magic of repetition. My biggest discovery this year has truly been <a href="https://letterboxd.com/director/carla-simon/">Carla Simón</a>. I started watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/summer-1993/"><em>Estiu 1993</em></a> and I liked it so much that I went right after that to another theater to watch <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/"><em>Romería</em></a>. I felt <em>Estiu 1993</em> was a really good movie and <em>Romería</em> was <em>okay</em>. By the end of the year I had watched her movies (including <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/alcarras/"><em>Alcarràs</em></a>) seven times. Every watch was better, and by now <em>Estiu 1993</em> is one of my favorite movies and I also learned to enjoy <em>Romería</em> on its own, which was <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/2/">my last movie this year</a>, third watch! On my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/romeria/1/">second watch of <em>Romería</em></a> I even had the chance to thank Carla Simón personally. Of course, I was so shy that I could only say <em>thanks</em> and leave. I think it was the first time I felt such respect for someone that I couldn’t even find words to tell her. I’ll definitely watch anything she directs.</p>
<p>One movie I had high expectations for this year was <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/sentimental-value-2025/"><em>Sentimental value</em></a>. In the end, I didn’t like it that much. Yes, hype is usually the problem. I can imagine some things from the movie I just wouldn’t like no matter how many times I watched it, but this idea of repetition made me think again. Maybe I just need someone to push me for a rewatch, just like with <em>Aftersun</em>. If this somehow ends up being my favorite movie in three years at least I’ll be able to say I saw that coming. There must be so many movies I only watched once that would deserve a second chance… One thing I’m sure about is that I’ll never leave the cinema after a first watch saying <em>“This is my favorite movie”</em>. That’s just impossible.</p>
<p>Since we’re talking about repetition, you probably know this cringey <em>“History always repeats itself”</em> saying. If this applied to my cinema experiences, I would surely repeat this year.</p>

<section id="dear-cinemas" class="level1">
<h1>Dear cinemas</h1>
<p>One of my best cinema experiences (if not the best) this year was rewatching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/cinema-paradiso/"><em>Cinema Paradiso</em></a> after nine years. I can assure you a great part of this was watching it in a cinema, actually a very special, single room cinema, which has been around for almost fifty years in a hidden corner of Madrid. Only me and one couple in the whole room. What an emotional evening. I also wrote a quite personal review which I cherish the most. It seems I was inspired. I had no particular ties with that cinema. In fact, it was my first time there, but it felt like home.</p>
<p>Going to the cinema is important for me. I decided not to watch movies at home, although I broke this <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/only-yesterday/">a</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/fire-will-come/">few</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/summer-1993/1/">times</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/frances-ha/">throughout</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/ugetsu/">the</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/chungking-express/1/">year</a>. Most of the exceptions came from paying for <a href="https://www.filmin.es/">Filmin</a> for one month, since <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/fire-will-come/">one day</a> I got home and I was so worn out that I didn’t even feel like going to the cinema (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6EJXBMQwtrs">am I sinking again?</a>). Shortly after, I would already be craving cinema again. I find the concept of only watching movies in theaters quite romantic. I can’t really decide what to watch besides which cinema to choose. I need to accept whatever they decide to screen. Imagine my joy the day I finally see <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/yi-yi/">some</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-human-condition-i-no-greater-love/">long</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/before-sunrise/">awaited</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/wings-of-desire/">movies</a> being screened. Although most of the time I just see this as a chance to watch some movies I would otherwise postpone to death. Surely I can’t binge watch <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/nights-of-cabiria/">Italian</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/la-strada/">classics</a> or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/ikiru/">Japanese</a> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/tokyo-twilight/">classics</a> for the rest of my life, as much as I’d like to…</p>

<p>You might argue going to the cinema so many times is expensive, and you’d have a point. I know I spend way more than the average person, but that’s just my decision, since I watch many premiere movies throughout the year and I like to think I’m supporting independent theaters (I’ve never left a theater feeling it was a loss of money, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/film/the-zone-of-interest/">not even that day</a>). I also acknowledge this idea of going to the cinema is kind of selfish since you can’t enjoy it as much in most cities out there. Thankfully, I live in Madrid (spam incoming!). If you’re willing to restrict your cinema visits to non-premiere movies, in Madrid for example you can go any number of times you want in a year with just 40€ at <a href="https://www.cultura.gob.es/cultura/areas/cine/mc/fe/difusion/programa.html">Cine Doré</a>. At the time of writing this, they’re carrying out some renovations, and meanwhile all their tickets are free! Of course, this is just a temporary exception, but the annual pass is still affordable. Other inexpensive theaters are <a href="https://www.cinetecamadrid.com/">Cineteca</a>, <a href="https://salaberlanga.com/">Sala Berlanga</a> and <a href="https://www.circulobellasartes.com/cine-estudio/">Círculo de Bellas Artes</a>.</p>
<p>Spending money to go to the cinema is neither a pride nor a shame. For me it grew as a necessity. Some people spend money on traveling, because that’s what they <em>need</em>. They need to break out of their <em>routine</em>, and that’s completely fine. As for me, I travel through cinema. Yes, I know you’ve heard that phrase many times, and I won’t invoke that word I said I wouldn’t use again. But I don’t care. Routine is subjective. That’s how I feel. As for you, do what you <em>need</em>. Do what fulfills you.</p>
<p>If you liked the idea of this post and you want to do something similar for your 2025, I’d love to read about it. I’m sure you also have a place that feels like home. The sports fan goes to the stadium, the teacher to their classroom, the farmer to their field, the sheep to their grassland, the chemist to their lab, the artist to their atelier, the <em>gymbro</em> to their gym… I go to the cinema.</p>

<p>You can’t imagine how much fun I had writing this post (and choosing the stills!). It seems like it got a bit out of hand. Spending these last days going through so many memories of my year… I hope I managed to capture a tiny bit of that.</p>
<p>While finishing this post, one day I took a short break to check whether there was any movie worth watching in theaters that day. After a while I found myself reading the profile of a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/nelodylan/">random Chinese Letterboxd user</a>. Luckily I know <a href="../../posts/the-hidden-voices-of-chinese-characters/">a bit of Mandarin</a> (laughing again at my shameless self-references), enough to be able to understand the first sentence in their bio. It reads something like <em>“Movies are merely movies. Many things are way more important”</em>. Simple phrase, hits me hard. I don’t think it contradicts anything I’ve said here. The rest of their bio is the Hermann Hesse quote I included here as a tribute to this user, which I think clarifies what the user tried to convey. I had read nothing by Hermann Hesse, but now I assure you I will, just because of this encounter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PTdwzibimfw">I think it’s nice that we share the same sky</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you don’t mind my Letterboxd hyperlink frenzy throughout the post. I think it’s a non-invasive way of introducing lots of recommendations for you, my dear reader. If I’ve managed to pique your interest in some of them I’ll be satisfied. I tried to include many movies that have been important to me, but I can’t mention everything. If you’re still curious, you can also check a quick list I made of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/list/mis-dramones/">forty of my favorite movies</a>. It is of course beautifully incomplete and I might have missed many great ones. I like dramas. I think that’s all you need to know. Also don’t take <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lbm364dl/">my four favorites</a> too seriously, I change those from time to time to give my profile a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>This year I also started writing. Although it’s nothing too serious, it meant a lot to me. Countless times under the inspiration of my cinema visits I would feel the urge to create something myself. I think breaking that wall between consumer and creator is a natural development for oneself. Ultimately, it is an act of honesty. When you create something, you must first do it for yourself.</p>
<p>Shoot for you. Play for you. Write for you. Everything else is incidental.</p>
<p>See you next year.</p>

<h1>Overture</h1>
<p>Revolutionary mathematics. Pointless death.</p>
<p><em>You fancy writer, enough with the overblown intros, give me my math!</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A young mathematician. A sleepless night. A mind well aware of the mathematical relevance of his fresh ideas. Years of frustration under self-imposed labels. <em>Misunderstood</em>. <em>Ahead of his time</em>. The eve of a fatal duel. A mathematical testament. A <em>coquette de bas étage</em>. Infatuation. A gunshot. An everlasting romanticized entry in the history books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the story you’ve heard, isn’t it?</p>
<p>History is harder. The figure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a> as a precocious mind is undeniable. These stories are great engagements into mathematics, but are often exaggerated or fantasized. We’ll shortly try to get these down to earth in this introduction.</p>

<p>Revolutionary mathematics. Évariste Galois essentially gave birth to two big branches of mathematics, group theory and Galois theory. What an unexpected name for the second one, right? We will soon start getting our hands dirty with the same mathematics that were driving the passion of a young Galois, and then <em>you</em> will have to judge whether they were really <em>revolutionary mathematics</em>. You will try to actively approach his life through his mathematics.</p>
<p>Galois had a short life. He died at the age of 20. Despite this short life, he wrote his arguably most important paper (the one which showcases his <em>revolutionary</em> ideas and often referred to as the <em>first memoir</em>) four years before his death, roughly at the age of 17. This is of course far from the common belief of him writing down all his theory just the night prior to his death. My intention in this post is going through this first memoir, to introduce you to Galois’ ideas as close as possible to how he himself viewed them back then. We will start doing this after a few shamefully long but I believe necessary motivation sections.</p>
<p>Pointless death. <em>But why did he die so young?</em> Ah, yes, these mathematicians needing some love and doing anything in their hands when they get a chance. And let’s just throw in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13ycbnu/til_that_%C3%A9variste_galois_a_math_prodigy_who/">some Reddit jokes</a> because why not. In reality, this is an obscure part of Galois’ life and we can’t really tell for sure what happened. If you think dying in a duel for the woman you love is weird, wait until I tell you about this one.</p>
<p>In some accounts they say Galois staged his death. He was so involved into politics that he was willing to give his own life to the republicans, so that his death would help starting a riot and eventually, another revolution. I don’t know if you find this more believable than the love duel… But there’s some logic here. In his last letters, Galois was talking about his own death like it was something unavoidable. You tell me, if you were really going out there for a duel, you would try as hard as possible to win and thus live, right? You’re only sure about your death if you’re not willing to try in the first place.</p>
<p>This theory seems more reasonable to me, but who cares about my opinion? You can also have your own. Anyway, if this one was really the plan, history was evil. The riots on Galois’ death were supposed to start at his funeral, but just one day after his death, the one of the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Maximilien_Lamarque">general Lamarque</a> followed. These news completely eclipsed those of the not so broadly known mathematician. Lamarque’s death did start a rebellion, but was soon stopped. If we look back at Galois, this was, indeed, a <em>pointless death</em>.</p>
<p>The ideas that originally led to the creation of new branches of math thanks to Galois can be summarized in a short phrase. <em>The study of solutions of polynomial equations</em>. If I give you an equation like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B3%7D%20+%205x%20-%202%20=%200">, can you find out which values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> satisfy this relation? This question quickly evolves into a more intriguing one… <em>Can I always write down a formula for the solutions of any equation you give me?</em> These are the sort of questions Galois and his math predecessors were interested in. Despite finding remarkable answers at such an early age, we shouldn’t feel discouraged. We should rather reframe our view. <em>If the most basic form of this theory was originally developed by a high schooler, what prevents me from understanding it?</em> As for almost anything, I think this barrier is just <em>hard work</em>. I like to think that Galois’ sleepless nights immersed into his mathematics speak for themselves.</p>
<p>We’re going to follow Galois on this journey.</p>
<p>You’ll have to <em>do</em> mathematics.</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning. Writing a blog with aesthetically pleasant math formulas is totally not easy. They have to look good in all kinds of devices. For this reason, the safest workaround so that I don’t risk someone seeing absolute rubbish is to use horizontal scroll bars when the formula might otherwise overflow the screen. This will rarely appear on a large monitor but will be quite frequent in mobile devices, and I think there’s no way to force a scroll bar actually showing on mobile browsers, so I had to warn you. If you feel like a formula is going out of the screen, please try to scroll it even if you don’t see a scroll bar! Here, an example:</p>

<p>Our <em>good ol’</em> friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations… Ok, yeah, they didn’t formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them. For us, this is a second degree equation in the modern sense:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20ax%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20bx%20+%20c%20=%200%0A"></p>

<p>Huh…</p>
<p>This is supposed to be an entry to <a href="https://some.3b1b.co/prize">Summer of Math Exposition #4</a>. If you check this link, you’ll find one part that goes like this:</p>

<p>Well, well, we just started and I’m already digging my own pit. I think I’ll just wait for someone else to address that in a whole post. If you happen to be one of those confused students and you end up here, well, good luck with that. You have all your time. Don’t think the post will be an <em>easy</em> read. But as for the prerequisites, I don’t expect from you anything more than the algebra and complex numbers you were taught in high school.</p>
<p>While you probably knew the above formula with the coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a,%20b,%20c"> just like that, I’m going to be using the same letter with subscripts, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_i"> is the coefficient of the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7Bi%7D">. Moreover, note that the coefficient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n"> of the highest degree term (here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2">) is useless: the equation obtained from dividing everything by that coefficient will have the same roots.</p>

<p>This last relation exactly means that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> is also a solution of the new equation, which has no coefficient for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D"> term.</p>

<p>So the equation we’ll work with looks like this:</p>

<p>We haven’t talked about which values can the coefficients of the equation take. We could decide that they can be <em>any natural number</em> (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0,%201,%202%5Cdots">), <em>any integer</em> (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0,%201,%20-1,%202,%20-2%5Cdots">), <em>any rational</em>… From now on, we’ll assume they’re rational numbers.</p>

<p>This is just a fancy term for fractions, the result of dividing one integer by another. They are things like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0,%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D,%20-%5Cfrac%7B57%7D%7B3%7D,%20-2">… Of course, integers are also rationals because any integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7B1%7D">.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And why not choosing, say, just integers? Because we need some freedom with the operations we do with coefficients. When we talked about dividing everything by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2">, we were already considering that the new coefficients had to be at least rational. Otherwise, depending on which division we perform, if we had integers initially, we could now end up with something that isn’t an integer anymore. Thus, if we choose rational coefficients we’re allowed to do basic operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with them and always be sure that the result will still be a rational number.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s dividing fractions… What’s dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?</p>
<p>— <em>Only yesterday</em> (1991)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I’m not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an excuse to include a part of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/only-yesterday/">one of my favourite movies</a>, where Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand the logic behind dividing fractions. <em>Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it like that?</em> This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception. I also feel like this, even while doing my research to write this post. Many suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it, meaning that you shouldn’t force yourself too far to get the logic behind some concepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While I do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I will try my best in this article to build some intuition.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-how-did-you-get-there">But how did you get there?</h2>
<p><em>Shut up and memorize!</em></p>
<p>Just joking. Let’s see what we can do…</p>
<p>In the previous section we talked about equations and solutions. We might sometimes still use that terminology, but we’re also going to talk about polynomials and roots. For our purposes, an equation can be expressed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(x)%20=%200">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(x)"> is a polynomial. In the quadratic example, the polynomial would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(x)%20=%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20a_1%20x%20+%20a_0">. A root of the polynomial is any value that gives an output of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> when plugged as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> into that polynomial. Therefore, a solution of the equation is a root of the polynomial.</p>
<p>Suppose we give names <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> to our hypothetical roots. If something is a root, as we just said, it should evaluate the polynomial to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">. This must work for both roots, so when factored out, the polynomial should look like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x%20-%20x_1)(x%20-%20x_2)">. Here, if we change <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> by either <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">, the result will be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> as expected. Can you express the coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_0"> in terms of the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">?</p>

<p>Let’s expand the product:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20x_1)%20(x%20-%20x_2)%20=%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20(-%20x_1%20-%20x_2)%20x%20+%20x_1%20x_2%0A"></p>
<p>But considering the original polynomial looked like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20a_1%20x%20+%20a_0">, that means we have the following equalities for our roots:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20x_1%20+%20x_2%20&amp;=%20-a_1%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_1%20x_2%20%20%20&amp;=%20a_0%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cool thing about these relations is that the result of adding or multiplying the roots is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals), even if the roots themselves might not be rational. In fact, knowing that, any weird expression made up of sums and products of roots, say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B(x_1%20+%20x_2)%5E%7B3%7D%7D%7B3x_1%20x_2%7D%20-4(x_1%20+%20x_2)(x_1%20x_2)%5E%7B6%7D">, will be <em>rationally known</em>. I’m using these words on purpose, because that’s how Galois himself referred to quantities that ultimately evaluate to a rational number, even if the operands themselves aren’t necessarily rationals (like our roots). Keep this cool observation in mind, you’ll see why in just a while.</p>
<p>So we have to figure out a formula for both roots. They’re just two now, yes, but you know this is going further, right? We will work with higher degree equations later. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could just find the value of <em>one</em> thing, and then get the value of all roots <em>for free</em> just from that? Of course, besides this weird value, we’re also allowed to use the original coefficients of the polynomial or any other known numbers.</p>
<p>I’ll help you with that. There are probably a lot of values we could choose to find, but I’ll give you this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2%0A"></p>
<p>Of course you’re now supposed to check that this does <em>encode</em> everything about the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">. Can you write them in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">?</p>

<p>Well, instead of computing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, let’s try with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%5E%7B2%7D">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%5E%7B2%7D%20=%20(x_1%20-%20x_2)%5E%7B2%7D%20=%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20-%202%20x_1%20x_2%20=%20(x_1%20+%20x_2)%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20x_1%20x_2%0A%20%20%5Coverset%7B%5Ctext%7Bcool%20obs.%7D%7D%7B=%7D%20a_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%0A"></p>
<p>You do know what happened in the last step, right? The cool observation we made earlier. We put everything in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20+%20x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2">, so we can then use the known rational coefficients, and we’re done. We know what <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%5E%7B2%7D"> is, so we can now pick a square root and have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204a_0%7D">.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now that we know the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, getting back the values of the original roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> is routine substitution in the equalities we stated earlier.</p>
<p>But before claiming our trophy in the form of a final result, let’s expand our perspective a bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we’re sure that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is a root, and we know how to solve this new equation. That way we would get the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, just like above, hoping that it would be easier than trying to solve the original equation.</p>
<p>So… How does such an equation look like? The one I’ll show you won’t be too surprising, and you’ll even think I’m just making fun of you, but keep in mind I’m trying to prepare a recipe for future sections. Alright, the equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20t)(x%20+%20t)%20=%200%0A"></p>
<p>Of course this equation makes sense. We already made a useful observation before. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> has to be a root, there must be a factor like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x%20-%20t)"> out there. The reason we also included <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x%20+%20t)"> is that now this product will give a neat result, as you might expect from before. Yes, we just happen to know that because we already calculated <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%5E%7B2%7D"> before, and this seems to be some circular reasoning, but bear with me, this will be a useful reinterpretation later…</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%0A%20%20(x%20-%20t)(x%20+%20t)%20=%200%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%5CDownarrow%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20-%20t%5E%7B2%7D%20=%200%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%5CDownarrow%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20=%20t%5E%7B2%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%5CDownarrow%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Bt%5E%7B2%7D%7D%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D%20=%20t%0A%5Cend%7Barray%7D%0A"></p>
<p>At this point you might be wondering why I never bother to write the typical sign <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpm"> to represent that we could take either the positive or the negative value, in this case, when taking the square root. At least for our quadratic example, this is irrelevant! Why? Well, you just look back at the relations:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_1%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20+%20t%7D%7B2%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_2%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20-%20t%7D%7B2%7D%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A"></p>
<p>If we take the positive value, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D">, then we get the solutions:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_1%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20+%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D%7D%7B2%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_2%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20-%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D%7D%7B2%7D%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A"></p>
<p>If we instead take the negative value, i.e., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20-%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D">, then our solutions will be:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_1%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20-%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D%7D%7B2%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20x_2%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B-a_1%20+%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_1%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204%20a_0%7D%7D%7B2%7D%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A"></p>
<p>They’re the same but swapped! So who cares? We just wanted to find the roots in the first place, we didn’t even define what should be called <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> and what <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">, there’s just no difference. This also somehow addresses another question you might have had. We want to find the value of the root <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> from the new equation. <em>But how do we even know which one of the roots is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">?</em> Well, as we just said, it turns out any of them works… The more general answer to this question isn’t that easy, but will play a crucial role in our understanding of these equations, and we’ll get back to it later. <em>No spoilers</em>.</p>

<h1>First symmetry</h1>
<p>I bet you know what’s coming next… But before we try to tame that naughty cubic equation, we need some polynomial machinery. We’ll find some symmetries along the way, I hope you’re excited!</p>
<p>Let’s recall the cool observation from previous section:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20x_1%20+%20x_2%20&amp;=%20-a_1%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_1%20x_2%20%20%20&amp;=%20a_0%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A"></p>

<p>We got our relations!</p>

<p>I know you’re seeing the pattern for the coefficients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sum of all roots, negative sign</li>
<li>Sum of all products of two different roots, positive sign</li>
<li>Sum of all products of three different roots, negative sign</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Now pay attention to this. If we have an equation of degree <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, in coefficient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_i">, we have all possible different ways of choosing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n-i"> roots. What happens if we swap any two of the roots? Of course, nothing! We rearranged some sums and products, but since the order doesn’t matter, and we were including all possible products, we still have the same result! We say that these expressions are <em>symmetric</em> polynomials. A polynomial on the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1,%20x_2,%20%5Cdots,%20x_n"> is <em>symmetric</em> if it doesn’t change no matter how we rearrange the roots.</p>
<p>The symmetric polynomials we’ve been working with actually have a special name: they’re called <em>elementary symmetric polynomials</em>. Just to make it clear, the <em>elementary symmetric polynomials</em> we’ve seen so far are the following:</p>

<p>Any guess for why they’re called <em>elementary</em>? I’ll give you a few examples to think.</p>
<p>Let’s take for example this polynomial:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x_3%5E%7B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>It is obviously symmetric, since all three terms are squared and the order of the sum doesn’t matter. However, it’s not an <em>elementary symmetric polynomial</em> itself. The closest elementary one from above might be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3">, but ours has each term squared, so it doesn’t fit that pattern exactly.</p>
<p>Can we actually know its value? Let’s rewrite it…</p>

<p>Yes! That’s a known rational number.</p>

<p>Let’s try another symmetric polynomial:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20+%20x_2%5E%7B3%7D%20x_3%20+%20x_3%5E%7B3%7D%20x_1%0A"></p>
<p><em>Oops!</em> This is not a symmetric polynomial! Can you see why? It needs a small fix:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20x_3%20+%20x_1%20x_2%5E%7B3%7D%20x_3%20+%20x_1%20x_2%20x_3%5E%7B3%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Yes, much better now. Can you prove this one is indeed symmetric? Hint: it’s enough to check swaps of two roots. That’s because any rearrangement of roots can be explained as a series of swaps of two roots. Now, is this also a known value?</p>

<p>Well, this one also worked. Do you see where I’m going?</p>
<p>We were already observing in a previous section that any expression written in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials has a known rational value, no matter how complicated the expression may be. An expression written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials is of course symmetric, because each of these terms is. But can we go further?</p>
<p><em>Any symmetric polynomial can be written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.</em></p>
<p>I hope you agree this is not obvious at all. And the statement just like that doesn’t seem too interesting. Because we know that elementary symmetric polynomials are known rational numbers, then we get this more insightful result for free:</p>
<p><em>Any symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number.</em></p>
<p>We’ll use this result a few times later. Of course, we should prove the first statement about elementary symmetric polynomials. In Galois’ time, this was such a well-known fact that he didn’t even bother including it in the prerequisites for his memoir.</p>
<p>Unless you’re really really interested at this point, you could simply believe the statement is true and keep reading, and only come back later. Or you can skim through the proof and don’t stress yourself if something isn’t entirely clear. This is a really important result, but it’s just a building block for more things that are coming.</p>

<p>This won’t be a super general rigorous proof, but you’ll get the idea and by the end you should be able to write down something yourself. The idea of the proof is constructive. What’s a constructive proof? We prove something exists by actually building a recipe that, if followed, will arrive at that thing. Sounds familiar? Yeah, I told you previously that we’re building another recipe, but more on that later. In this case, this thing is <em>a way of writing the symmetric polynomial in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials</em>.</p>
<p>To get an idea, let’s come up with a <em>different</em>, more naive way of finding that representation for one of the previous examples, the polynomial</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20f%20=%20x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20x_3%20+%20x_1%20x_2%5E%7B3%7D%20x_3%20+%20x_1%20x_2%20x_3%5E%7B3%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Suppose we would like to arrive at an expression that doesn’t include the first term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20x_3">. Why that term you may ask? I promise, I’ll tell you later! We’ll try to find a clever symmetric polynomial that also has this term, so then we can get rid of it by subtracting this polynomial from the original <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> one. How would such a polynomial look like? Look at the coefficients of our term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20x_3">. They’re <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3,%201,%201">. Now look at this cool expression:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B3%20-%201%7D%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B1%20-%201%7D%20(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%0A"></p>
<p>This expression has a lot going on, but if you focus on each first term summing, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2%20x_3">, the expression certainly contains at least the following term:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x_1)%5E%7B3%20-%201%7D(x_1%20x_2)%5E%7B1%20-%201%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20x_1%5E%7B3-1+1%7D%20x_2%5E%7B1-1+1%7D%20x_3%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%5E%7B1%7D%20x_3%5E%7B1%7D%0A"></p>
<p>This is the term we wanted! We got it. We found a polynomial that doesn’t contain our term. How does it look like? Hopefully it’s simpler…?</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20f%20-%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%20=%20-2%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%20-%202%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%20x_3%5E%7B2%7D%20-%202%20x_1%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%5E%7B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Geez… Is this a joke? This seems as hard as the original polynomial! How did it get any better? Trust me… Let’s keep going! We now try to find another one that doesn’t contain the first term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3">. You already know how the trick works, don’t you? Except we now also have a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2"> in there, but that’s not a big deal, just multiply by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2">… Recall our coefficients this time, they’re <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2,%202,%201">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20-2%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%20-%202%7D%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B2%20-%201%7D%20(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20-2%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3)(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%0A"></p>
<p>Again, this will at least contain the following term:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20-2%20(x_1)%5E%7B2%20-%202%7D(x_1%20x_2)%5E%7B2%20-%201%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20-2%20x_1%5E%7B2-2+2%7D%20x_2%5E%7B2-1+1%7D%20x_3%5E%7B1%7D%20=%20-2%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%5E%7B1%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Got it! Let’s see what the new polynomial is…</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20f%20-%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%20-%20(-2)%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3)(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%20=%200%0A"></p>
<p>Oh, we must’ve been so lucky there, the result is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">! Then we can just express <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20f%20=%20(x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%7D(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%20-2%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3)(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%0A"></p>
<p>These are all elementary symmetric polynomials! And we can even factor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2%20x_3"> so we get exactly the same expression we found earlier by just pure observation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20f%20=%20((x_1%20+%20x_2%20+%20x_3)%5E%7B2%7D%20-%202%20(x_1%20x_2%20+%20x_1%20x_3%20+%20x_2%20x_3))(x_1%20x_2%20x_3)%20=%20(a_2%5E%7B2%7D%20-%202%20a_1)(-a_0)%0A"></p>
<p>What did we gain here? Remember, we’re trying to build a recipe that can work in general for any symmetric polynomial. To make sure this is the case, we need to revisit some questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why did we choose to remove those specific terms?</li>
<li>Can we always construct the polynomial with fancy exponent subtractions?</li>
<li>Will this whole procedure always somehow end in a finite number of steps?</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t tell you, but I wrote the polynomials above in a special order. Have you heard of lexicographical ordering? Such a fancy term. All it means is that you compare things one by one, from left to right. In our case, the terms are compared lexicographically based on their coefficients. We first compare the coefficients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">. If they’re different we’re done. Otherwise we check <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">, and so on… The constant numbers that multiply terms are ignored.</p>
<p>Now we can answer the first question. The chosen term is the largest one lexicographically. In the original polynomial, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%5E%7B3%7D%20x_2%20x_3"> is larger than both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2%5E%7B3%7D%20x_3"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20x_2%20x_3%5E%7B3%7D"> because when comparing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, we have from the coefficients that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%3E%201">. In the polynomial from the second step, we got <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3">. This is larger than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2%20x_1%20x_2%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%5E%7B2%7D"> for the same reason as before. It is also larger than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-2%20x_1%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%20x_3%5E%7B2%7D">, since in this case we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%20=%202"> for the coefficients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, but we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%20%3E%201"> for those of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">.</p>
<p>What about the second question? This is a matter of making sure the exponents are non-negative. Did you see the pattern? If we have a term with some coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%5E%7Ba_1%7D%20x_2%5E%7Ba_2%7D%20x_3%5E%7Ba_3%7D">, the exponents will be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1%20-%20a_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2%20-%20a_3"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_3">. For the subtractions, this all means that the coefficients must form a non-decreasing sequence, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1%20%5Cge%20a_2%20%5Cge%20a_3">.</p>
<p>But why would this be true? Because the polynomials are symmetric! I mean, the original one is symmetric, and the ones at each step are too, because they’re the original one minus some other symmetric polynomials, so the whole result is also a symmetric polynomial. Now, suppose we chose the lexicographically largest term but, for example, we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2%20%3C%20a_3">. Because the polynomial is symmetric, it is the same when swapping <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3">, so there should also be another term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%5E%7Ba_1%7D%20x_2%5E%7Ba_3%7D%20x_3%5E%7Ba_2%7D">. But this term is lexicographically larger than the one we chose before! That would mean we failed at picking the largest one, so we should choose this one instead, which does satisfy that the coefficients are non-decreasing. Therefore, for the lexicographically largest term, we always have the non-decreasing coefficients and the subtractions can’t be negative.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the third question… Why would this procedure even finish? It turns out this is also a consequence of the lexicographical ordering! But be careful. Suppose we have a sequence of three numbers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1,%201,%201)">. There can be infinitely many sequences that are lexicographically smaller. How come? Just choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%201,%201)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%202,%201)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%203,%201)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%204,%201)">, … You get the idea.</p>
<p>But in our case, we’re getting a smaller one at each step of the procedure. This is not exactly the same. Imagine we start with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%200,%203)">. In the worst case, it would take three steps to finish if we have the sequence:</p>

<p>What about starting with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%201,%201)">? The next one could be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%201,%200)">, but then we can only keep going if we subtract from the second element. Even if we’re unlucky and the next one is something like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%200,%20100)">, we would still finish eventually. What about starting with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1,%202,%203)">? I think you get the idea…</p>
<p>But intuition isn’t always spot on. The rigorous answer as for why this ends relies on a property called <em>well ordering principle</em> for our lexicographical ordering. Again, just a fancy term. It means that, if I give you any bunch of different sequences, you can always find <em>the smallest one</em>. How come? Well, start by finding the minimum value among all the first elements. There might be more of those, just pick all of them. Now, among these, do the same for the second element, and so on… In the end we get a single one.</p>
<p>Now suppose our procedure never finishes. This is the same as saying we get an infinite list of sequences, each one smaller than the previous one. What’s <em>the smallest one</em> here? No matter which one we choose, there are always other smaller ones! This is a contradiction, because we said we can always find the smallest element. Then we failed at assuming the procedure never finishes.</p>
<p>In addition, if we keep going freely, the only time we can’t keep going is when we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(0,%200,%200)">. And we must finish at some point because of the previous argument. So we must finish here. When talking about our polynomials, this means the term looks like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%5Ccdot%20x_1%5E%7B0%7D%20x_2%5E%7B0%7D%20x_3%5E%7B0%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> is some constant known number. So we don’t necessarily end at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">, but at any known number.</p>
<p>We’re done.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The proof we saw gives a recipe that can be followed for any symmetric polynomial, and will give us a way of expressing it in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, and thus, in terms of known numbers. Most of the times we’re only going to use this result to assert that some symmetric polynomial <em>is</em> a known number, without caring about what number it might be. In the cases we do want to know the specific number, we now have a way of finding it. It might be a stupidly long procedure, but it can be done. And because of that, we don’t have to do it ourselves! We could feed this set of instructions to a computer, and in theory it will do it for us. There’s actually one place in the next section where I tell the computer to do it because I’m also too lazy to do these calculations…</p>

<p>Time for the cubic! Just to recap, this is what we have to start with:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%5E%7B3%7D%20+%20a_2%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20a_1%20x%20+%20a_0%20=%200%20%5Ctext%7B%20where%20$a_0$,%20$a_1$,%20$a_2$%20are%20rationals%7D%0A"></p>

<p>Remember what we did in the Second degree section? We were discussing the possibility of finding a special value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> which could encode all the information about our roots, in the sense that we could find their values just from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> itself and other known values. For the quadratic we used <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2">. Can we find such a value for the cubic?</p>

<p>Yes we can! Did you think about complex roots of unity? If you like following the pattern, for the quadratic we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20%5Calpha_1%20x_1%20+%20%5Calpha_2%20x_2"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_1,%20%5Calpha_2"> are the solutions of the equation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20=%201">. These are of course <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-1">.</p>
<p>What are the solutions of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B3%7D%20=%201">? They’re <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega"> is a complex root of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x%20+%201%20=%200">. Then, again just following the pattern, we could think of the following special value:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%20=%20x_1%20+%20%5Comega%20x_2%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%0A"></p>
<p>This is just a hunch! In order to use this, we should actually show that all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> can be expressed in terms of this <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and other known values.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now that we got the value, it’s time to show that the roots can be expressed in terms of this <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">… Or that’s what I thought while writing this. Too optimistic… I’m not saying it’s not possible, but it can be quite difficult to get those formulas.

<p>We can try to sum all three equations multiplied by specific coefficients so that our root remains there and the other two are cancelled out à la reduction method, because of the given relation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega">.</p>
<p>Doing that, we get these formulas for the roots:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20x_1%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7Bt%20+%20t'%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_2%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t%20+%20%5Comega%20t'%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_3%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Comega%20t%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t'%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%5Cright.%0A"></p>

</div>
<p>OK, so we can get the roots by using both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'">. Yes, I know what you’re thinking. We now have to find two values instead of one, but trust me, this is justified, since these values seem so similar that I hope we’ll be able to find both of them <em>at the same time</em>.</p>
<p>You already know how this goes, now we have to build a polynomial for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is a root, and hopefully, just hopefully, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'"> will also be one of its roots. Let’s recall, or rather expand, the way we built the polynomial for the quadratic case. I told you it would be helpful later, and the time has come.</p>
<p>Remember that we had <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2">. Our special polynomial for the quadratic was this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20t)(x%20+%20t)%20=%20(x%20-%20(x_1%20-%20x_2))(x%20+%20(x_1%20-%20x_2))%20=%20(x%20-%20(x_1%20-%20x_2))(x%20-%20(x_2%20-%20x_1))%0A%20%20=%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20-%20((x_1%20-%20x_2)%20+%20(x_2%20-%20x_1))%20x%20+%20(x_1%20-%20x_2)(x_2%20-%20x_1)%0A"></p>
<p>You already know what the actual polynomial is, but I left it in this last form to notice something: the coefficients are symmetric polynomials on the roots! If you try swapping <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> in both expressions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?((x_1%20-%20x_2)%20+%20(x_2%20-%20x_1))"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x_1%20-%20x_2)(x_2%20-%20x_1)">, you get the same result. In the previous section, we just saw that all symmetric polynomials on the roots are actually known values. They’re made from the coefficients of the original equation, which were rational, so we got a new equation with rational coefficients.</p>
<p>Of course, there <em>is</em> one concern. Perhaps this new equation is just as hard to solve as the original one, and then we did something completely useless. While that’s a possibility, we were hoping that our choice of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> would make the new equation sufficiently easy to solve. In the case of the quadratic, you know that this was true because we were able to lose the term of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">, and get a simpler quadratic <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20-%20t%5E%7B2%7D%20=%200">, which only requires to take a square root to solve.</p>
<p>We saw the coefficients we got in the end are symmetric polynomials, but we could have deduced that from the start, from the way we defined the polynomial as a product. Yes, in the quadratic example it was easier to see why we would benefit from choosing both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-t"> (sum times difference is the difference of squares). Another way to look at this is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-t"> is the result of swapping the roots in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20(%5Ctext%7Bt%20with%20no%20swaps%7D))(x%20-%20(%5Ctext%7Bt%20with%20roots%20swapped%7D))%0A"></p>
<p>This form is telling us that this is a symmetric polynomial <em>on the roots</em>, and therefore, that its final coefficients will be known rational values. Can you see why? I’ll let you figure that out, because now it’s your turn again… Can you use this idea to find a suitable new polynomial for the cubic, for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'"> are two of its roots? Just to remember, these are their expressions:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20t%20&amp;=%20x_1%20+%20%5Comega%20x_2%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20t'%20&amp;=%20x_1%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20x_2%20+%20%5Comega%20x_3%0A%20%20%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright.%0A%20%20%5Cquad%0A%20%20%5Ctext%7BThe%20value%20$%5Comega$%20is%20such%20that%20$1+%5Comega+%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20=%200$%7D%0A"></p>

<p>And this is certainly the same polynomial. For the quadratic, all the possible rearrangements are only swapping both roots or leaving them the same way.

<p>The previous hint talked about <em>all rearrangements</em> of the roots. This should already be a really good hint. Yes, we’re doing exactly that.

<p>There are quite some things going on there, so you’d better pause and check those relations hold. Note that we also included <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'"> in there! We now see that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'"> was just one of the expressions obtained from the rearrangements of the roots in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Of course, now we’ll build a polynomial that has all of these as roots, so in particular it will have both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'"> as roots, just like we wanted! The reason I wrote the equalities above is so that we now don’t have to write the absolute beast that this polynomial would be as a product. We will instead just write the right side of the equalities:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20t)(x%20-%20t')(x%20-%20%5Comega%20t)(x%20-%20%5Comega%20t')(x%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t)(x%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t')%0A"></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we’re going to have fun trying to simplify this… But by now we should know that, no matter how complicated it looks, in the end, this should be a polynomial with rational coefficients. It’s a symmetric polynomial on the roots, <em>we</em> made it like that by multiplying all rearrangements of roots.</p>
<p>What happens if we try to multiply only those terms having <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">? I’ll let you check that, but the product simplifies nicely because of the relations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20+%20%5Comega%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20=%200"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B3%7D%20=%201">:</p>

<p>We can of course do the same with the terms involving <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20t')(x%20-%20%5Comega%20t')(x%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t')%20=%20x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20t'%5E%7B3%7D%0A"></p>
<p>So because of the useful relations that we got from the roots of unity, our product simplified into this much cleaner expression:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20t%5E%7B3%7D)(x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20t'%5E%7B3%7D)%0A"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yes, we still have some work to do to simplify that…</p>

<section id="i-aint-doing-that" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-aint-doing-that">I ain’t doing that</h2>
<p>I really like these <em>boxes</em> that help hiding <em>spoilers</em> and try to encourage you, my dear lazy reader, to work through some of the steps on your own. Of course, we can’t hide everything inside these boxes and the text must keep flowing. I’ll now have to show how the polynomial we were looking for in the previous section looks like, but I’m showing a simplified expression. The moral of the story is that the <em>spoiler</em> isn’t the polynomial itself, because it’s simplified. The real <em>spoiler</em> is the series of steps you needed to get there! Remember we’re trying to build intuition.</p>
<p>And in fact, we already got a lot of intuition from the previous section! This section is only meant to show you that we can actually end and get the solutions of the cubic, although it’s more of a rutinary calculation from here on. You and me are both lazy human beings that don’t bother doing those mundane calculations, do we? Let’s see what we can do…</p>
<p>We left at this point:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20t%5E%7B3%7D)(x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20t'%5E%7B3%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>We can expand that product and get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%5E%7B6%7D%20-%20(t%5E%7B3%7D%20+%20t'%5E%7B3%7D)%20x%5E%7B3%7D%20+%20t%5E%7B3%7D%20t'%5E%7B3%7D%0A"></p>
<p>See, the values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%5E%7B3%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'%5E%7B3%7D"> don’t have to be rationals themselves, but since this came from a symmetric polynomial on the roots, the coefficients must be rationals! And we want to try solving a polynomial with known coefficients… OK, OK, you don’t have to calculate those coefficients if you don’t want to. I’ll tell you what they really are, but we’ll give them short names <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> for a while after that:</p>

<p>Let the computer do the boring stuff for you! We can use the <code>sympy</code> package available in Python. If you’re interested but never used Python, it’s fine, most of it reads more or less like math, so you can probably still read through the steps below.</p>

<p>Yes! We got a really neat expression:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%5E%7B3%7D%20+%20t'%5E%7B3%7D%20=%20-%2027%20a_%7B0%7D%20+%209%20a_%7B1%7D%20a_%7B2%7D%20-%202%20a_%7B2%7D%5E%7B3%7D%0A"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ll use the actual values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> later, just to not write too long equations. It turns out we end up with a surprisingly cool equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%5E%7B6%7D%20-%20u%20x%5E%7B3%7D%20+%20v%20=%200%0A"></p>
<p>Another way to look at it is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%5E%7B3%7D)%5E%7B2%7D%20-%20u%20(x%5E%7B3%7D)%20+%20v%20=%200%0A"></p>
<p>Can you see it? This is really just a quadratic equation!</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%5E%7B3%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bu%20%5Cpm%20%5Csqrt%7Bu%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204v%7D%7D%7B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>We can obviously just take a cube root now and obtain a solution:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%20=%20%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Cfrac%7Bu%20%5Cpm%20%5Csqrt%7Bu%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204v%7D%7D%7B2%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p><em>No, this isn’t one solution, these are a lot of solutions!</em> Yes, that’s right. We already had this kind of discussion before, right? In this case, we have two possible values for the inner square root, and three possible values for the outer cube root. The six possible solutions! Which ones are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'">? Unfortunately, in this case, we can’t just choose any combination.</p>
<p>By now I think it’s time we get rid of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'">. How come? Well, we already derived a useful relation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%0A%20%20t%20%5Ccdot%20t'%20=%20-%203%20a_%7B1%7D%20+%20a_%7B2%7D%5E%7B2%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%5CDownarrow%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20t'%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B-%203%20a_%7B1%7D%20+%20a_%7B2%7D%5E%7B2%7D%20%7D%7Bt%7D%0A%5Cend%7Barray%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Let’s go back to our original equations for the roots. We originally wanted to get back the roots by just using one quantity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and other known values. We finally made it!</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20%20x_1%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7Bt%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_2%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t%20+%20%5Comega%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20x_3%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Comega%20t%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D%20-%20a_2%7D%7B3%7D%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A%5Cright.%0A%5Cquad%0A%5Ctext%7Bwhere%20%7D%20k%20=%20-3%20a_1%20+%20a_2%5E%7B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Did the question change in any way? How do we know which root of the new polynomial is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> we want? Of course, we could always try all six possible values in these equations for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3">, and double check if they really are solutions of the original cubic equation.</p>
<p>Will you do that for me? Well…</p>
<p>Before we die in the attempt, let’s try to give some short expressions for all six roots. We will fix one of them and get the others in terms of that one. We’ll call this one <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, but this is just a name for a fixed root, it could be any of them. Suppose then that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%20=%20%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Cfrac%7Bu%20+%20%5Csqrt%7Bu%5E%7B2%7D%20-%204v%7D%7D%7B2%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>When taking cube roots, one way of writing all three of them is to fix one and multiply by roots of unity to get the others (because of course you get the same if you again raise to the third power). That means another two roots are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%20t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20t">.</p>
<p>What about the other three? We should take the negative sign for the square root inside. If we call that one <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t'">, we then have the relation we defined earlier:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20t%20%5Ccdot%20t'%20=%20k%20%5CRightarrow%20t'%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D%20%5Cquad%20%5Ctext%7Bwhere%20%7D%20k%20=%20-3%20a_1%20+%20a_2%5E%7B2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>So another root is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D">. Since there’s also a cube root there, we can pick another two roots to be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D">. So after fixing one root <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, all six of them can be expressed like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%0A%20%20t,%20%5Comega%20t,%20%5Comega%20%5E%7B2%7D%20t,%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D,%20%5Comega%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D,%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bt%7D%0A%20%20%5Cright%5C%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Remember this <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> was just some fixed root. If we use this one, in the equations above for the roots, we would get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> in that order. That’s basically just the definition. How about trying to input <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%20t"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> appears in the equations?</p>

<p>We got another rearrangement of the roots! What kind of witchery is this? Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to become tired of writing these equations… I claim that each one of the roots of the new polynomial gives a different rearrangement of the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> when introduced in the formulae of the roots. Thus, <em>any</em> root of the new polynomial will give us valid solutions for the original equation, no matter which one we take. Of course, you don’t need to trust me, you can check it yourself!</p>

<p>Yes, we have the cool result that any root of the new polynomial is valid for getting the original solutions of the cubic. But what do you think about these neat rearrangements? Are they only useful for the above conclusion, or can we do more with them? Was this a coincidence, or a more general result? Save some popcorn for later. I warned you.</p>

<p>In the third degree section we found ourselves solving the general cubic equation thanks to this special value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20+%20%5Comega%20x_2%20+%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20x_3">. I think we managed to justify why this special one is quite helpful for solving the cubic. I mean this in the sense that, the new equation we have to solve is simple enough, so that finding one of its roots is easier than finding a root of the original equation, even if the new one has sixth degree.</p>
<p>Anyway, a natural question would be: <em>Are there other special values that allow us to solve the original equation in the same way?</em> And we’re now only interested in the theoretical question. We don’t mind if the new equation is hard to solve or not. We really only want to know if there are other special values which encode all information about the roots.</p>
<p>Let’s try ourselves! I’m a bit tired of writing monstrous equations though. We’ll try with a specific example, of which we could even know the roots in advance. Remember this is just a sort of thought experiment. OK, so our cubic equation will be this:</p>

The polynomial <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x%20+%201"> is already familiar to us, and we defined its solutions as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">.</p>

<p>So we now know the three solutions of this equation. We’re cheating! Who cares? Let’s try a different special value! If you recall, we used <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2"> for the quadratic equation. Well, let’s just try it with the cubic as well, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Suppose we like defining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20=%202">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2%20=%20%5Comega">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3%20=%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">. Then we can have these relations:</p>

<p>As in other examples, this is a matter of summing all equations, each one multiplied by a certain number to cancel out the roots we don’t want. After you find the correct numbers you get:</p>

<p>Yes! It turns out we can use a different special value, and still be able to encode the information of all roots.

The new equation from which we get the values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is that one with products of all possible rearrangements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Since we’re cheating and we already know the roots of the original polynomial, we can save ourselves from building that new polynomial monstrosity and directly write down all its six roots. In case you’re a bit lost, I’ll tell you the first one, which comes from no rearrangement: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2%20=%202%20-%20%5Comega">.</p>

<p>The right side of each equation is the actual rearrangement of the roots. I only wrote the left side to show you they can be written in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, and in case these alternative expressions are useful to you to more easily plug them into the root relations to calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3">.</p>

<p>Now for the final step! Let’s try to get those roots back from the values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. I said values in plural on purpose. In the general cubic, we somehow got the striking result that all values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> are valid because they just give back a different arrangement of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3">.

<p>Huh… What is this absolute rubbish? We expected some neat rearrangements of the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">, and, well, we got that for the first two possible values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, but we got some ugly results for the others… Unfortunately, we’ll have to conclude from this that not all solutions of the new equation can be used to get the solutions of the original one.</p>
<p>But we can certainly use <em>some</em> of them. You see, the ones corresponding to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%20-%20%5Comega%20=%20t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7Bt%7D"> did give the intended solutions. Now the next question should be: <em>Is there some rule to know exactly which solutions of the new equation do retrieve the solutions for the original one?</em></p>
<p>In this case, let’s consider a smaller part of the new equation. Let’s compute the product of only those two factors including the roots that worked:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20(x%20-%20(2%20-%20%5Comega))(x%20-%20(2%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D))%20=%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20-(2%20-%20%5Comega%20+%202%20-%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D)x%20+%20(2-%5Comega)(2-%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>In fact, this is already a polynomial with known coefficients! The coefficient for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> simplifies thanks to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1+%5Comega+%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D%20=%200">, and we already computed the product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(2-%5Comega)(2-%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D)"> before. The polynomial is then:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20-3x%20+%207%0A"></p>
<p>The whole point of computing a huge product of all rearrangements was that we were sure the resulting polynomial would have known coefficients. We didn’t expect that, at least in this case, a smaller polynomial containing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> would already have known coefficients. We could already find <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> from this even easier polynomial, since it’s just quadratic. And thanks to our half-failure from before, we also know that the other four roots were completely useless.</p>
<p>Following on that idea, remember when we factored the original polynomial because one of the roots was an integer. The other part would then be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20+%20x%20+%201">, and we know from quadratics that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2%20+%20x_3%20=%20-1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2%20%5Ccdot%20x_3%20=%201">. In the <a href="first-symmetry">First symmetry</a> section we learned that:</p>
<p><em>Any symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number.</em></p>
<p>In this example, because of the root <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> already being rational, we can use the same reasoning for only the other two roots, so we can be even more specific:</p>
<p><em>Any symmetric polynomial on the roots <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> is a known number.</em></p>
<p>This shows that, at least sometimes, if we confirm a polynomial on the roots is unchanged by some of the rearrangements, not necessarily all of them, we can already be sure that its result is a known number.</p>
<p>What about the other way around? If we know a polynomial on the roots is a known number, will it always be unchanged by those specific rearrangements?</p>

<p>So what have we learned?</p>
<ul>
<li>The roots of our original polynomial <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B3%7D%20-%20x%5E%7B2%7D%20-x%20-%202"> are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">.</li>
<li>Any polynomial expression on these roots satisfies a special property related to rearranging the roots of the expression.</li>
<li>This property is that the operations of “<em>not rearranging any root</em>” and “<em>swapping <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D"></em>” together completely determine when a polynomial on the roots simplifies to a known rational number.</li>
<li>We got these two operations from the rearrangements obtained by plugging the roots of the polynomial with known coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20-%203x%20+%207"> (which was smaller than expected) into the expressions for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3"> in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</li>
<li>From the monstrous polynomial with all rearrangements of roots in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, the polynomial <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E%7B2%7D%20-%203x%20+%207"> is actually the factor with lowest degree that has known rational coefficients and includes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%201%20-%20%5Comega"> as one of its roots. It can’t have degree 1 because that would mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-%5Comega"> is a rational number. Maybe this “polynomial with lowest degree that has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> as a root” is a good rule of thumb in general?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>But we already learned how to solve cubics… Why should I care about all of this?</em> There’s a high chance you’re asking yourself that question. I’ll clarify shortly. We’re on the verge of finding an <em>invariant</em> of the original polynomial. This is how mathematicians refer to some special property that is inherent to an object. Something that doesn’t change.</p>
<p><em>But what could change here?</em> Well, in the above example we chose a specific labeling of the roots (we said that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1%20=%202">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2%20=%20%5Comega"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_3%20=%20%5Comega%5E%7B2%7D">) and we also chose a certain special value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%20x_1%20-%20x_2">. And we now know there might be more than one such value that works. Just imagine being able to create the same object, no matter which choice we wake on the order of the roots or the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</p>

<h1>Afterword</h1>
<p>I’ll tell you a bit about this post. After all, this is a personal blog.</p>
<p>I studied math and computer science. Because of that, the curriculum for both was shortened as compared to studying each one individually. I didn’t have a Galois theory class, so I decided to write <a href="https://oa.upm.es/70885/">my End of Degree Project</a> on this topic. It was basically like studying a more advanced math class, nothing else. Just some hand-waving of complex mathematical structures like groups, rings and fields. Surely it was a good way to develop my math skills, but looking back at my final writing, it has no particular interest. No attempt to make the topic more appealing. Too generic and boring writing style.</p>
<p>That was three years ago, when I finished my studies. I convinced myself that I had enough with the math side and I’d better get some software engineering jobs and call it a day. Three years later, math is waiting for me to catch up. I’m starting a master’s degree in math soon.</p>
<p>This post is basically me saying <em>I could’ve done better. Writing is fun.</em></p>
<p>My initial intention was writing a kind of summary of the content I covered in my End of Degree Project. This was reinforced after finding a surprisingly short (just six pages!) introduction to the topic titled <em>Galois Theory for Beginners</em>, written by John Stillwell. I still think it’s a good read, but making a text short is usually the opposite of an <em>easy</em> read. I was also finding myself again trying to understand the concept of a <em>Galois group</em>, looking for something a bit more intuitive than its modern definition using automorphisms.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take a look at some existing introductions of Galois theory out there, be it YouTube videos or written posts. These are contents I watched/read myself, I won’t judge if they’re good introductions or not, you can do that yourself. Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCU9tZ2VkWc&amp;t=1869s&amp;ab_channel=Mathemaniac"><em>(video)</em> Why you can’t solve quintic equations (Galois theory approach)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EWUsef0iFs&amp;ab_channel=MathKiwi"><em>(video)</em> But why is there no quintic formula? | Galois Theory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aUsTlBjspE&amp;ab_channel=Aleph0"><em>(video)</em> The Insolvability of the Quintic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct2fyigNgPY&amp;ab_channel=MathVisualized"><em>(video)</em> Galois Theory Explained Simply</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-galois-theory-anyway"><em>(written)</em> What is Galois Theory Anyway?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nrich.maths.org/articles/introduction-galois-theory"><em>(written)</em> An introduction to Galois theory (NRICH)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, my favourite one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSHv9Elk1MU&amp;ab_channel=notallwrong">Why There’s ‘No’ Quintic Formula (proof without Galois theory)</a>, which, as the name says, is not really an introduction to Galois theory, but deals with the same topic as this post (the unsolvability of the quintic), from a different perspective. This is a video originally based on the article <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/394/ArnoldQuintic.pdf">Arnolds’s elementary proof of the insolvability of the quintic</a>, which is by itself a worth read. To my knowledge, there’s still no introduction based on John Stillwell’s text. I think that would be a great addition to the world of Galois theory exposition intros.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also started reading Laura Toti’s biography of Galois. While reading a lot of mentions to his first memoir in there, I was starting to consider the idea of reading that memoir myself, just out of curiosity. Before this, I never really tried reading such old original works. And I started reading Galois’ first memoir. And once I started understanding the basic ideas, I decided that was the way to go in this post. Just do what Galois did.</p>
<p>The original works of Galois are translated to English in the book <em>The mathematical writings of Evariste Galois</em> by Peter M. Neumann. Galois himself also has a rather verbose writing style. Maybe this was true in general for works from that time, compared with modern math works, I’m not sure. I can just tell I like his writing style. The problem is, there are some parts where he isn’t very clear or he just leaves empty gaps to fill, and I needed some help to follow them.</p>
<p>That’s how I arrived at what I believe is the main source for this post, <em>Galois Theory</em> by Harold Edwards. In his book, he basically does the same we tried to do here, that is, to try to present Galois theory in the same way Galois himself did it. This book covers a larger content than what I specifically wanted for this post, and he also doesn’t mind using some modern concepts to draw the connections with modern Galois theory. To keep the post as elementary as possible, I tried to avoid that.</p>
<p>And that’s how we got here. Unfortunately, most of the still unwritten second half of the post covers the real content from Galois’ first memoir. But there’s already a lot of intuition in the existing portion. Until I manage to finish writing everything, I encourage you to try more polynomial examples similar to how we did in Cubic, <em>u still there</em>? and try to develop your own intuition. Maybe you end up proving some results yourself! As we said, you really learn math by doing it.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the content.</p>

<h2 class="hide-heading anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-have-a-chat">Let’s have a chat</h2>
<div class="right-quote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The decipherment of Hieroglyphic Egyptian required the replacement of the deep-seated notion of symbolism by the correct view that the main (though not the only) feature of the script is phonetic.”</p>
<p>— Cyrus H. Gordon, <em>Forgotten Scripts</em>, 1968, p.&nbsp;24</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Roughly 80% of Chinese characters can <em>speak</em>—whether in something close to Mandarin or in the ancient utterances of Old Chinese, understood only by scholars. They’re not particularly talkative, capable of producing just one or two syllables in their own language. In fact, the only thing they were ever taught to say, is their own name.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Teacher</strong>: Chinese characters are not difficult. They are just pictograms <sup>1</sup>—simplified drawings representing real things. Try to guess what these mean: 一, 二, 三, 火, 雨, 山, 木…</p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: Oh! Clearly those first three represent the numbers 1, 2 and 3. I can imagine 火 represents <em>fire</em>, perhaps 雨 represents <em>rain</em>. The character 山 is definitely a crown, so maybe it stands for a king…? Hmmm… I think 木 is a depiction of a slingshot—yeah, someone is aiming and about to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher</strong>: I can see where you’re coming from, but 山 actually represents a mountain. And as for 木—well, you’ve got quite the imagination, but it’s just a tree. Surely you see that 女 shows a woman with her legs crossed, right? <sup>2</sup></p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: Huh… well, now that you mention it, and with a bit of imagination… Let’s also pretend men didn’t like crossing their legs in ancient times.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher</strong>: Ok, let’s try a harder example: the character 玛, which can mean <em>agate</em>, a type of precious stone. It consists of two parts: 𤣩 and 马. - The first part 𤣩 comes from 玉, which depicts three pieces of jade strung together on a string. When used in other characters, it takes the form 𤣩 and typically relates to gems. - The second part 马 is the simplified version of 馬, which is a depiction of a horse.</p>
<p>In ancient times, some traders would showcase their gemstones—like agates—at markets. But some buyers would question their authenticity. To gain trust, traders would also show off their magnificent horses, symbols of wealth and elegance, just like the gems themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: Wow, seems like these ancient Chinese people also had some imagination… Anyway, how is this story specific to <em>agate</em>? It could just as well apply to any other precious stone, right? And wait—how do you even pronounce this character? We haven’t even talked about pronouncing characters! Such a cool story for the meaning, but maybe there’s more to it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve ever started learning Chinese, you might find the previous dialogue somewhat relatable. If you’ve delved deeper, perhaps you already know that characters can <em>speak</em>. Or maybe you still think of them as mute individuals, silent figures that only convey meaning (I made up the story for 玛—guessed it?). Of course, you could argue that this dialogue is exaggerated and that teachers do mention that phonetic parts of characters are a thing, and you would have a point. However, this is often only briefly touched upon, whereas pictogram-based explanations tend to dominate. Only these, in turn, are the ones that stick with students, shaping their perception of Chinese characters for the rest of their journey.</p>
<p>Consider the following set of characters: 七, 十, 五, 三, 一, 六, 九, 四, 八, 二. These are the Chinese characters for the numbers from 1 to 10, but shuffled in a random order. Would you be able to guess them if you didn’t already know them? From the previous dialogue, you should already know that 一, 二 and 三 are 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As for the rest, if by any chance you have some strong detective-like intuition and manage to figure them out, I would be delighted to know how<sup>3</sup>. For the rest of us, they’re just a bunch of strokes put together, following no apparent easy <em>ideogram</em> explanation like for the first three numbers. Why these choices? Open your ears wide—you will slowly start unraveling the hidden voices of the characters!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="excuse-me-can-i-borrow-your-sound">Excuse me, can I borrow your sound?</h2>
<p>Okay, our previous game wasn’t fair. Instead, I could have told you that the number 4 is written as 亖, and you would, of course, believe me. How is this not better than 四? What is 四 even representing?</p>
<p>You see, Chinese people like their characters stylized. The character 亖 was once the representation of the number 4 in ancient times, but they must have felt that four horizontal strokes were too much—not exactly in line with their idea of beautiful characters. They could have chosen other visual ways to represent numbers (<em>good ol’</em> tally marks?), but instead, they took another ingenious path.</p>
<p>Enter the world of <em>sound loan</em>.</p>
<p>Because spoken language is older than written language, people already had a <em>sound</em> for the number 4 (<em>sì</em>). Incidentally, the <em>sound</em> for ‘to exhale’ was also <em>sì</em>—believe it or not, it was originally represented by 四 (trust me, this is a depiction of a nose). Can you connect the dots? There was a character, 四, that already had a meaning (<em>to exhale</em>), but people also started using it for another meaning (<em>the number 4</em>) just because the sounds matched. Now, for the number 4, the character only tells us how to say it, there’s no direct meaning involved! As is often the case with these examples, over time, the original meaning of ‘to exhale’ gradually fell out of use. It was later represented by 呬, with a <em>mouth</em> (口) component added to reinforce the meaning and distinguish it from 四. Even so, the character 呬 eventually became obsolete too, with speakers now opting instead for compound words (terms made of at least two characters).</p>

<p>No matter if the explanation for the number 4 left you satisfied or disappointed, the truth is that the characters for the rest of the numbers follow the same concept of <em>sound loan</em>. We could now discuss the next number, the number 5, which is represented by the character 五 (wǔ). A sharp reader might try to explain that this character is made up of five strokes, so maybe there were five individual lines at some point in the past. In fact, a more experienced Chinese learner would know that the character is actually written with four strokes (one with a bend), not five, and even if we look at early texts, there are only four well defined strokes, following a crisscross pattern, which was also the original meaning. While there are some theories that try to explain this choice, the most logical one is still—you guessed it—just a <em>sound loan</em>. The sound for the number 5 happened to match, so the character was borrowed just for its sound.</p>

</div>
<p>This pattern of borrowing a character only for its sound and using it to represent a meaning completely unrelated to the original character’s meaning is quite common in general—it’s not limited to numbers. For instance, another one of the first characters Chinese learners see is 我 (wǒ), which is used as the first person singular pronoun (‘I’ in English). This character is a depiction of a trident-like weapon. You already know where this is going, don’t you? Yes, just a <em>sound loan</em>.</p>
<p>I am not a linguist myself, but I am at a point where I find knowing the <em>real</em> explanations (i.e., the most widely accepted by scholars) much more satisfying than coming up with a mnemonic story to remember the character and its meaning, even if the latter seems easier. In the end, we still have to learn by repetition. Anyway, I have nothing against mnemonics themselves (Heisig enjoyers, <em>u there</em>?), as long as we acknowledge that the vast majority are made up. However, there is usually only a really thin line between these stories and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology"><em>folk etymology</em></a> (people thinking these stories are the real origins of the meanings). Maybe some readers have heard the popular explanation for 我—that it depicts a hand (手) holding a weapon (戈) to protect oneself (我). While the story sounds reasonable, scholars believe it to be a reinterpretation of the character into more commonly understood concepts, which is why it falls into <em>folk etymology</em>. In contrast, our sound loan explanation is simple but less sticky, which is why many people don’t find it useful.</p>
<p>Many students who start learning Chinese feel attracted by the characters so much so that they often fall for <a href="https://pinyin.info/readings/texts/ideographic_myth.html"><em>The ideographic myth</em></a><sup>4</sup>. Thus, methods like Heisig’s <em>Remembering the Hanzi</em> disregard character pronunciation, as if it were acceptable for students to turn a deaf ear to the characters’ voices. I myself used <em>Remembering the Kanji</em>—the equivalent for Japanese characters—when I was learning Japanese, and memorized hundreds of them without knowing how to pronounce them. There is actually a part 2 of <em>Remembering the Kanji</em> which focuses on mnemonic stories for how characters are read, although as far as I know this doesn’t exist in <em>Remembering the Hanzi</em>, making it rather detrimental.</p>
<p>I started with a popular statistic about 80% of Chinese characters being able to <em>speak</em>. This was to catch the reader’s attention, because in reality this percentage doesn’t include the <em>sound loan</em> characters introduced in this section. While not many people know about the widespread use of <em>sound loan</em> in common characters, others do know about another special type—the one actually being referred to when talking about the 80%—and potentially the most important when trying to decipher the characters’ voices.</p>

<p>Of course, let’s not forget that at some point in ancient times, before some were borrowed for their sound, all characters did have an original meaning. Recall, for example, the character 马 introduced in the dialogue, which is a depiction of a horse, as a simplified version of 馬. Do you still not see the horse here? Oh well…</p>

<p>Now the meaning argument goes like this: Chinese characters, when part of larger characters, still contribute their meaning as part of a compound explanation. If we believe this, then naturally, we must find a reasonable story to connect the pieces in the character 玛—we have to find a way to connect the seemingly unrelated meanings of its components <em>gemstone</em> and <em>horse</em>. While certain characters composed only of meaning components—known as <em>associative compounds</em>—are widely accepted, we shouldn’t force this idea onto the vast majority of compound characters, despite many attempts to do so.</p>
<p>Enter the world of <em>phono-semantic</em> compounds.</p>
<p>Our example 玛 (<em>agate</em><sup>5</sup>) has a much simpler explanation—though for some, a less satisfying one. The character 马 is pronounced mǎ, and, well, the character 玛 is pronounced—yeah, you guessed it—also mǎ. The character has a <em>meaning</em> component, 𤣩, which provides a small hint—indicating that it’s a kind of <em>gemstone</em>—and a <em>sound</em> component, which suggests its pronunciation but doesn’t necessarily contribute to its meaning. This is how <em>phono-semantic</em> characters work. Believe it or not, you now more or less understand how 80% of Chinese characters work.</p>
<p>Now that we know 马 can be used as a sound component, a Chinese learner might recall two other characters that are taught right at the start.</p>
<ul>
<li>The character 吗 (ma). This is used as a sentence-final particle<sup>6</sup> to denote yes-no questions. Particles are often another example of <em>phono-semantic</em> characters. They typically include the mouth 口 (i.e.&nbsp;<em>speech</em>) as the meaning component, alone with the sound component. In the case of 吗, our lovely horse provides the sound. Just note that the tone<sup>7</sup> is not the same, but as I mentioned earlier, the sound component serves as a hint and doesn’t need to be exactly spot on.</li>
<li>The character 妈 (mā), which means <em>mother</em>, usually also doubled as 妈妈. From the previous dialogue, you now know that 女 means <em>woman</em>. <em>What do women have to do with horses?</em> Oh, come on, Chinese characters are not a joke… Fortunately, by this point, you can already understand how this works: a <em>mother</em> is a <em>woman</em>, and 马 provides the sound—it’s as simple as that.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see where this is going. There are some characters which are commonly used as sound components of other characters, and 马 is one of them. But they don’t have to be just one type of component. In this case, 马 can also work as a <em>meaning</em> component in many other characters, and in these cases the meaning related to horses should be much more convincing than, say, my made-up story for 玛. A couple of examples (still <em>phono-semantic</em>) of 马 as a <em>meaning</em> component:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character 骑 (qí), which originally meant <em>to ride a horse</em>, but later on extended its meaning to riding in general (horse, motorcycle, bike…). Here, it makes sense that 马 provides the meaning, while the other component, 奇 (qí), provides the sound. <em>But wait, 奇 means ‘weird, unusual’… No, no, no, no, no, there is nothing weird about riding horses</em>. Remember, there’s no need to force meanings—it just provides the sound.</li>
<li>The character 驴 (lǘ), which means <em>donkey</em>. Again, 马 provides the meaning (a <em>donkey</em> is similar to a <em>horse</em>), while 户 (hù, meaning ‘door’) provides the sound. <em>Another witty joke?</em> Okay, okay, no more jokes. Here 户 just gives the sound. <em>But are hù and lǘ that similar sounds…?</em> Well, you decide. But do they really need to be? Not necessarily. How come? Bear with me—we’ll go back to this example in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sharp reader may have noticed that when the character works as a meaning component it appears on the left, and when it works as a sound component it appears on the right. This is a nice observation, and is true most of the time, so it can be used as a rule of thumb. However, always be careful because there are also exceptions where this pattern doesn’t hold.</p>
<p>The set of other characters where a specific character is used with the same function is called a <em>series</em>. In the case of 马, if you’re interested in more examples, the (probably non-exhaustive) series are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The sound series: 吗 (ma), 妈 (mā), 玛 (mǎ), 码 (mǎ), 蚂 (mǎ), 骂 (mà).</p></li>
<li><p>The semantic series: 骑, 驴, 验, 驻, 骗, 驱, 驶, 驾, 冯, 驳, 骤, 驰, 闯, 骚, 骄, 骇, 驼, 驯, 骆, 笃, 骏, 骡, 驭, 驮, 驹, 骁.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the number of characters commonly used as meaning components is a rather sane amount, the number of those used as sound components is I think way too large. However, I don’t recommend trying to memorize either sound or semantic series of characters, since I think this is something you pick up naturally while encountering the characters themselves, and I would instead focus on learning the most common characters. For instance, from the sound and semantic series for 马 presented above, I could probably identify the function of 马 in them without knowing the actual character, and honestly, I don’t even know most of them, and it would be useless to try to do so just because they happen to be in the same series.</p>
<p>At the end of the last section, I mentioned <em>Remembering the Hanzi</em> as a book that seemed to ignore the phonetic aspect of characters. Thanks to some fellow learners, I also became aware of a similar book in Spanish by Pedro Ceinos titled <em>Caracteres chinos</em> (<em>Chinese characters</em>). This one actually does seem to introduce phonetic components, trying to group the characters by their <em>series</em>, but it always tries to enforce a meaning along with the sound. In the book’s introduction he explains this point of view, which he shares with a few other scholars, that no sound component comes without a <em>slight</em> hint of additional meaning to the overall character, effectively saying that <em>almost</em> all sound components are also meaning components at the same time. In addition, even though he mentions the concept of <em>sound loan</em>, in the actual characters where this happens he doesn’t identify it, relying only on meaning-based arguments.</p>
<p>While most scholars believe that sound loans and sound components can stand on their own without adding any additional meaning—just like I tried to convey here—I still think authors like Ceinos are laudable for their hard work. He himself states that he’s no linguist, and his book is a result of his own experiences and beliefs, not necessarily aligned with other linguists’ point of view, which he is well aware of.</p>
<p>By now, I think you can’t deny that characters <em>do speak</em>, and sound is a crucial part of most of them. Unfortunately, you may still encounter some tricky characters whose voices you will struggle to understand. Although this can be quite challenging, we will devote the next section to at least try to decipher some of them.</p>

<section id="i-think-im-just-a-bit-empty" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-think-im-just-a-bit-empty">I think I’m just a bit empty</h2>
<p>In this article, I’m focusing on simplified Chinese characters, which are used in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia, because that’s what most foreign learners start with, although I think experienced learners should know both simplified and traditional scripts. For example, 馬 is the traditional <em>horse</em>, while 马 is the simplified counterpart. Traditional characters are now mainly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Until the last century, they used to be a single script with maybe some character variants. We won’t try to address <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1012040"><em>why and when they changed</em></a> but rather what they changed and how these changes affected the understanding of the characters’ etymology.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we saw 驴 (lǘ) as an example of a <em>phono-semantic</em> character, where 户 (hù) gave the sound. While you could believe this works as a sound hint, another person might argue they are quite different. While in some cases the answer won’t be too satisfying, in this case, it’s quite simple. The traditional version of 驴 is 驢, and it turns out that the phonetic component’s (盧) sound is lú, which seems much more accurate. What happened here?</p>
<p>Enter the world of <em>empty</em> components.</p>
<p>When characters are simplified in one way or another, we’re doomed to lose some important information about them. In the previous example, the simplified component 户 can be known as both an <em>empty</em> component and a <em>sound</em> component. When simplifying characters, there are a few ways to do it. In this case, 户 doesn’t look excessively similar to 盧, nor does its sound, but together they somehow work as a simplified alternative. It can be called <em>empty</em> because it lost its original form, although it can also still be called a <em>sound</em> component because it still conveys a small sound hint. Simplifying characters often comes at a small cost—they become harder to understand logically.</p>
<p>Other times, however, the simplified character works quite well without losing any significant parts. Let’s have a look at 认 (rèn), which can mean <em>to know</em> (part of the common compound 认识, rènshi, <em>to know</em>), and whose traditional character is 認.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>meaning</em> component is 讠, which is the simplified version of 訁, meaning <em>speech</em> or something related to <em>speech</em>, giving the overall meaning <em>to recognize, to admit, to know</em>. One of the common simplification techniques is the regularization of cursive script. In fact, our lovely 马 also comes from a cursive variant! In some cases, this may still look similar to the original character and thus not be considered an <em>empty</em> component. Additionally, this simplification of some characters is consistent and always used this way when it works as a component in other characters.</li>
<li>The <em>sound</em> component is 人 (rén), which is totally not a reasonable simplification of 忍 (rěn) when it comes to its form, and can thus be considered an <em>empty</em> component. But keep in mind that its function was only as a sound hint, and the simplified alternative also does this pretty well, so it’s still a perfect sound component in the simplified character. We couldn’t ask for more. Also, remember that it’s fine for characters to work as either meaning or sound components, so in this case, just because 人 (meaning person) is almost always a meaning component (written as 亻) when part of other characters, you don’t need to force a meaning, it can also just work as a sound component.</li>
</ul>
<p>Was that okay? Well, now for the real mess… A character that often appears as an <em>empty</em> component in simplified characters is 又 (yòu), which would by itself be a depiction of a <em>right hand</em>, and looks something more similar to ㄡ when used as a component on the left side. Let’s see some examples in characters that may be familiar even to inexperienced Chinese learners:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character 汉 (hàn), which can now reference the Han ethnic group, and is also part of the word 汉字 (hànzi), which means <em>Chinese character</em>. The 又 is an empty component and used to be the sound component 𦰩 (jiān) for the traditional variant 漢.</li>
<li>The character 难 (nán), which now means <em>difficult</em> just by pure <em>sound loan</em>. However, before that, its original meaning was a type of bird, with 又 being an <em>empty</em> component, simplification of 𦰩 (jiān) from the traditional variant 難. What? The same one as for 汉? Then it’s always like this? <em>Ha!</em> Not even close… Just wait and see the next ones.</li>
<li>The character 对 (duì), which now means <em>yes</em> or <em>to face</em>, among other things. Here the 又 is an <em>empty</em> component, simplification of 丵 and 土 in 對. It used to represent something related to developing the land, certainly not a sound component, maybe later a <em>sound loan</em>, but well, I won’t even try to explain this one because I don’t even get it myself.</li>
<li>The character 欢 (huān), which can mean <em>happy</em>. Here the 又 is—you guessed it—an <em>empty</em> component, simplification of 雚 (guàn), a sound component in <em>the</em> traditional… What? Well, somehow there are <em>four</em> different variants in the traditional script—歡, 驩, 懽, 讙. At least the sound component is the same in all of them…</li>
<li>The character 观 (guān), which means <em>to observe</em>. Your good friend 又 is yet again here trying to hide another sound component, this one again being 雚 (guàn), from the traditional variant 觀.</li>
<li>The character 鸡 (jī), which means <em>chicken</em>. You obviously know what function 又 plays, and it used to be 奚 (xī), a sound component for the two different variants 鷄 and 雞 of the traditional script.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! That really was a mess… And believe me there are like ten more characters where 又 is an <em>empty</em> component. When confronted with these difficulties, one could only think that maybe traditional characters are not that hard, since their components are <em>completely</em> more consistent.</p>
<p>Another unfortunate example of <em>empty</em> component can be found in 续 (xù), which can mean <em>to continue</em>. Here, 卖 (mài) is supposed to be the sound component. Well, this doesn’t sound quite similar… Its traditional form is 賣. It turns out that this is accurate for the single character 卖, but for our original one 续/續, the component 賣 was actually a simplification of 𧶠<sup>8</sup> (you’d better <em>zoom</em> your screen if you can’t tell the difference), which is pronounced yù (much more similar to xù). Therefore, the sound component was quite accurate at some point in the past but turned into an <em>empty</em> component when it was simplified to the unrelated 賣, leaving us apparently with two different sounds for the same character. But now you know the reason.</p>

<p>We’re bringing the third act to a close, but there’s still one thing I want to talk about. In the first sentence of the article, I mentioned that characters can produce <em>utterances of Old Chinese understood only by scholars</em>. Although not directly related to <em>empty</em> components, this phenomenon can also disguise the real intentions, just like <em>empty</em> components do. I will try to explain what I meant with another example.</p>
<p>Consider the character 也 (yě), which can now be used by <em>sound loan</em> to mean <em>also</em> or can be used as a particle<sup>9</sup>. The following is, again, a non-exhaustive list of its sound series: 他 (tā), 她 (tā), 牠 (tā), 地 (dì), 施 (shī), 池 (chí), 驰 (chí), 弛 (chí), 㐌 (yí), 匜 (yí). <em>What?</em> There are at least five different sounds here! What’s going on? Well, as almost always, the explanation can be quite simple, although not too satisfying.</p>
<p>You see, the sounds I showed you are the evolved modern sounds used in Mandarin for those characters. Thousands of years have passed, and spoken language evolves, so in the past, all of them would have had a similar sound, but they evolved into quite different sounds as time passed. For instance, some of them in Old Chinese are transcribed as <em>l̥ʰaːl, </em>l’els, <em>hljal, </em>l’aːl, <em>l’al, </em>hljalʔ, *lal. <em>No, no, no, I’m not an expert in Old Chinese</em>. I just though you would like to see the transcriptions yourself (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9F#Chinese">see this phonetic series table</a>). Unless we happen to be linguists ourselves, trained in the recognition of sound evolutions, this can just be a pain, but the only workaround is to acknowledge that these characters now have multiple voices, and we should take all of them into account. In the end, I guess we should just trust phonologists on this one.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-a-beautiful-recital">What a beautiful recital!</h2>
<p>By now, I just hope I didn’t disappoint you when I claimed that Chinese characters can <em>speak</em>. I will be satisfied if I helped you train your ear just a tiny bit so that next time you encounter a character <em>in the wild</em>, you’ll have a higher chance of deciphering its voice. Let’s review what we learned here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>sound loan</em> phenomenon. Sometimes characters are borrowed just for their sound, as simple as that. They had an original meaning but it started being substituted by another one whose spoken word sounded the same, perhaps because it was too abstract of a concept to build a real pictogram for. Example: 四 (sì), originally <em>to exhale</em>, but now <em>four</em> (sì), because it had the same sound.</li>
<li>The <em>phono-semantic</em> compound. Roughly 80% of Chinese characters are built from two blocks: a <em>meaning</em> component, which gives a small hint for its meaning, and a <em>sound</em> component, which gives a small hint for how it’s read. Example: 妈 (mā), from 女 (woman), <em>meaning</em> component, and 马 (mǎ), <em>sound</em> component.</li>
<li>The <em>empty</em> component. Sometimes a component undergoes a simplification process that loses the clearer sight of its function in the character, usually conveying misleading information (mostly about its sound). Example: the excessively large number of unrelated components that 又 simplifies, like 汉, 难, 对, 欢, 观, 鸡, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re now closer to becoming the conductor of the characters’ orchestra!</p>
<p>It was never my intention to make you think that learning and understanding Chinese characters is <em>easy</em>. Again, I still remember many years ago when I would immerse myself in playful stories and crafty mnemonics, with the sole purpose of getting my brain to remember a bit of these Japanese characters, which for some reason the Japanese thought it was a good idea to borrow from the Chinese hundreds of years ago. But at some point, I quit Heisig’s method out of pure boredom. I just wanted to <em>read</em>.</p>
<p>I started changing my strategy when I met etymology—<em>real</em> etymology. Although there were still some parts of the puzzle that I couldn’t put together at times, overall, the process of understanding the characters became increasingly clear. I was really starting to hear (and enjoy) the characters’ voices to the point that they would end up feeling like a real alphabet—not much different from a Latin alphabet (<em>ok, ok, just a few thousand more symbols</em>), but still a millennia-old script system that initially built itself on the pretense of pictographic roots yet eventually kept growing systematically out of the need to represent abstract and complex concepts that would otherwise prove impossible without stealing some voices from here or there, recycling some characters all over again, building their own monumental <em>hieroglyphs</em>, inducing false fantasies in the marveled Westerners whose eyes dreamed of <em>intellectual paintings</em>, <em>metaphysical and ideal pictorial algebras of the sciences and arts</em><sup>10</sup>, but still, down to its core, just another way to convey the power and beauty of language.</p>

<p><em>Pssst, the show is over…</em>. If you keep reading this, I’m assuming I somehow caught your attention and you’re interested in knowing more about Chinese character etymology. After this long journey, I wouldn’t want you to conclude that I wrote the whole thing just as a shameless advertisement. This post was born for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I barely ever write. But I wanted to give it a try. I just wanted to convey my interests in one topic and make an attempt at some serious writing. I can now say I enjoyed the process, and I hope I’ll keep writing in the future.</li>
<li>I <em>really</em> got into <em>real</em> etymology when stumbling upon <a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/">Outlier linguistics</a>. <em>Yeah, yeah, this is a paid service, blah, blah, blah</em>. Since it has been so useful to me, I also wanted to present it briefly here but not in the main article, lest it would feel like I’m trying to sell you something. If you’re curious and willing to spend a bit of money, maybe you could also read the second subsection.</li>
<li>Once I got to grasp the characters’ voices myself, and also being aware of many people who still haven’t, I just wanted to put my two cents here and link them to this so that they could widen their vision a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go to the resources!</p>
<section id="im-not-into-pay-to-win-theres-plenty-of-free-stuff-on-the-internet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="im-not-into-pay-to-win-theres-plenty-of-free-stuff-on-the-internet">I’m not into pay-to-win, there’s plenty of free stuff on the internet</h3>
<p><em>Yes, you’re right!</em> I’m also fond of free resources, particularly when you’re a student and can’t afford any paid alternatives. I have some interesting ones for you that I also use from time to time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page">Wiktionary</a>: I wasn’t paying too much attention to it in the past, but believe me, I used it <em>a lot</em> when writing this article. When looking at entries for Chinese characters, I mainly use the section called <em>Glyph origin</em>, which is where you can find information like the one I present here. Look, for example, at <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B">this entry for 四</a>, that I used to get some info for our <em>sound loan</em> introduction. There are probably not too many places with such a varied knowledge yet still detailed and quite accurate.</li>
<li><a href="https://hanziyuan.net/#home">Hanziyuan</a>: From 汉字源 (hànziyuán), meaning <em>source of Chinese characters</em>. This is a lifelong project by Richard Sears, popularly known as <em>Uncle hanzi</em> in China. He presents an astounding database of different versions of each character throughout history to see their evolution, along with additional data about the character, some related to its etymology and decomposition, though this information can sometimes feel a bit <em>cryptic</em>. The site can feel a bit old, but it’s still incredibly relevant. On the main page, there are also a few articles linked, but the links are broken. You can access them <a href="https://github.com/Dixin/Etymology/blob/main/docs/_posts/2017-09-17-why-study-chinese-etymology.md">here</a>. These are also an invaluable resource to get started in etymology and might also contain some additional explanations to better understand the sometimes <em>cryptic</em> information found on the site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dong-chinese.com/dictionary">Dong Chinese dictionary</a>: Okay, I must confess I haven’t used this one myself a lot, but probably because I only found it recently. I had a look at some dictionary entries and the origin explanations seem accurate. For instance, <a href="https://www.dong-chinese.com/dictionary/search/%E5%9B%9B">the entry for 四</a> is also in line with what we explained. It seems they take the origins seriously, as I read through <a href="https://blog.dong-chinese.com/2019/07/07/character-origins.html">this brief post</a>. Incidentally, they also mention a resource I wasn’t aware of, which they describe as <em>The most reliable and comprehensive source for character origins available online that I’ve found</em>. I’ll include it here as well, <a href="https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/search.php?word=%E5%9B%9B">again with our example for 四</a>. That one is only in Chinese—fortunately, we live in a time when we can use tools like ChatGPT for accurate translations, so that shouldn’t be a problem.</li>
<li><a href="https://zhongwen.com/">Zhongwen</a>: When talking about Chinese characters etymology, it’s impossible not to mention the <em>Shuowen Jiezi</em>, a character dictionary compiled by Xu Shen by the year 100 CE, which continues to be a relevant source to this day, even though some of its character explanations may now be considered outdated due to more recent research. Many tools try to break down characters into <em>radicals</em>, but doing so automatically usually results in a <em>horrible</em> and <em>meaningless</em> decomposition. On this site, you can navigate through a tree containing all characters and their inclusion relations as compiled manually by the <em>Shuowen Jiezi</em>. Each entry also contains a little explanation from the book itself and vocabulary examples. Keep in mind that the general tree is presented in traditional script, but the simplified version is also shown for each entry. Also, remember this is faithful to the <em>Shuowen Jiezi</em>, so some explanations may be outdated.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shuowenjiezi.com/">Shuowenjiezi</a>: <em>Tired of seeing short explanations from others that have read the Shuowen Jiezi for you? Then why not read it yourself?</em> Okay, this is a hardcore resource. Here, you can access the entire <em>Shuowen Jiezi</em> in Chinese, along with commentaries from Duan Yucai’s annotated edition from 1815 and many other sources. You must <em>really</em> like etymology if you end up here. Again, if you don’t speak Chinese, you can just translate, not a big deal. Another thing that I find awesome (and I value in any dictionary) is that you can click any character in the text and it directly goes to the entry for that character. A <em>paradise</em> for linguists and etymology <em>enthusiasts</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s acknowledge and appreciate the immense effort that so many people have put into compiling these resources and offering them for free. The world is a better place thanks to people like them.</p>

<p>After presenting such a useful list of free resources above, what are we left with? Can anything be better than that? Well, it depends on what you consider <em>better</em>. From those resources, apart from the <em>Dong Chinese dictionary</em> and, to a lesser extent, the <em>Hanziyuan</em> and the <em>Zhongwen</em> ones, in general, we can assume the vast majority of reliable etymology resources are not focused on Chinese learners, but rather on academia and research itself. Therefore, a Chinese language student might find them overwhelming (I’m aware you might have also felt like that when reading some parts of my article, and I’m sorry for that).</p>
<p>As much as I find all of this interesting, you would have a point if you said most of the information is quite unhelpful for learning the language. Unfortunately, I don’t remember when and how this happened, but at some point while I was learning Japanese I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/">Outlier linguistics</a>. I found myself watching their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng3UC894haQ&amp;list=PLebp9ufr_vijeQBbjFo7YHI6RaibrYFMI"><em>How Chinese characters actually work</em> playlist</a> and found it enlightening. Then I also read through some of their posts (the equivalents for Japanese, but I’m linking the ones for Chinese here), notably these—<a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/blogs/chinese/what-is-etymology-and-is-it-useful-for-learning-chinese-characters-part-1"><em>part 1</em></a> and <a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/blogs/chinese/what-is-etymology-and-is-it-useful-for-learning-chinese-characters-part-2"><em>part 2</em></a> (they have more nice free-to-read posts there if you’re interested).</p>
<p>The team at <em>Outlier linguistics</em> is made up of two people—<a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/pages/ash">Ash Henson</a>, who has a PhD touching many fields of Chinese linguistics, and <a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/pages/john">John Renfroe</a>, who basically got into Sinology by accident but none could stop him until he found himself researching in classical Chinese, Chinese paleography, history and archaeology. Surely this pair must know something about Chinese character origins.</p>
<p>These two put their efforts into building a reliable dictionary of Chinese character etymology, keeping up to date with research, and trying to provide only the information necessary for Chinese learners to understand how the characters form, without necessarily going into too much detail. I found this systematic approach extremely convenient when I would be reading some text and want to know about an unfamiliar character. I can basically do it in less than 30 seconds from my phone (it integrates with the <a href="https://www.pleco.com/">Pleco app</a>).</p>
<p>If you believe you can pay back for a service that makes your life easier and you can afford it, I would highly recommend <a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/products/outlier-dictionary-of-chinese-characters"><em>The Outlier Dictionary of Chinese Characters</em></a> (the <em>Essentials edition</em>). The <em>Expert edition</em> contains much more information in the spirit of the more detailed research resources I presented before, but since this is also a lot of work to do, for now, they only have this extra information for a subset of the characters. In any case, an amazing feature is that, even in the <em>Essentials edition</em>, they include at least one reference to a technical book as a source for their claims, making it extremely reliable, and you can use that as a starting point if you really want to delve deeper. For learners, though, the <em>Essentials edition</em> is enough, just consider the <em>Expert edition</em> if you use the <em>Essentials</em> and you absolutely love it.</p>
<p>From everything I presented, this is the resource I use the most without a doubt, and I also used it for some of the information included in this article (trying not to abuse it too much and also draw from open resources), so I hope the authors can forgive me by having devoted a whole subsection to their amazing dictionary. I won’t try to explain anything else; they already do it a hundred times better than me.</p>
<p>Lastly, for those of you learning Chinese, if you accept a little advice from another fellow learner, <em>just go and read</em>. Use all these resources just as a helpful secondary tool. Only access them when you find characters you don’t know. Don’t lose time trying to memorize words, or worse, individual characters. The best way to remember a word or character is through the frustration of not having been able to understand it in its context. And if you don’t understand the sentence, fear not! Tell <em>ChatGPT</em> to break it down and explain grammar points. You will grasp them in no time. <em>Just go and read</em>. Personally, I love <em>graded readers</em>. You can see some recommendations <a href="https://lahlahbanana.com/2022/04/27/chinese-graded-novels-readers-review/">here</a> (I’m particularly fond of the <em>Chinese breeze</em> series) and also learn more about <a href="https://lahlahbanana.com/2021/08/28/extensive-reading-the-secret-to-learning-chinese/"><em>extensive reading</em></a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>There is a subtle difference in wording here. First, characters like 一, 二 and 三 should be called <em>ideograms</em>, since they represent abstract <em>ideas</em> rather than <em>pictures</em> of real things. The other examples, however, should be called <em>pictograms</em>. While the terms <em>pictogram</em> and <em>pictograph</em> are sometimes used interchangeably, I would argue that <em>pictograph</em> is more precise when referring to ancient historical representations like cave paintings. In contrast, <em>pictogram</em> should be more appropriate when discussing characters within a writing system.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I’ve heard this explanation many times, and while it might seem reasonable, early depictions in texts suggest otherwise. The pictogram appears to more closely resemble a human figure with breasts, either kneeling or standing—not sitting with crossed legs. In that case, the inferred gender would be better explained by the presence of breasts, which would likely be a more convincing argument for our <em>confused</em> student.↩︎</p></li>

If you’re interested in knowing a bit more about the numbers, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Chinese_numerals/">this article</a> is quite interesting.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This is one chapter from <em>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy</em> by John DeFrancis, who seems to be controversial at times. I can’t tell you why, since I have only read this specific chapter, so I can’t speak for the rest, but at least this one I found quite inspiring.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The meaning actually comes as an abbreviation of 玛瑙 (mǎnǎo), from an earlier form, 马脑, which seems to be a mistranslation from Sanskrit, mistakenly understood as <em>horse’s brain</em>. So while originally even the horse part could have an explanation, here we only focus on the modern character. See the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%91%AA%E7%91%99#Chinese">Wiktionary entry</a> for more details.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>For the reader not familiar with particles, just think of them as characters without a real concrete meaning, which are used to give a sentence or a part of it a certain function or emotion.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>For the reader not familiar with tones, just keep in mind that the sound (<em>what you say</em>) is the same, but the intonation (<em>how you say it</em>) can be different. In Mandarin <em>pinyin</em> (the romanization of Chinese characters) we denote the intonations with different marks on the vowels.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>This character is itself a simplification. Initially I wanted to show here the absolute <em>beast</em> that is the older character 𧸇, but most likely you can’t see it in your device unless you have a special font installed that supports old characters. It’s not your fault. If you can’t see the one in this footnote, you can get an idea of how it looks like in the images I included.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>For the reader not familiar with particles, just think of them as characters without a real concrete meaning, which are used to give a sentence or a part of it a certain function or emotion.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Metaphors from an excerpt of <em>Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences, les arts, les moeurs, les usages, &amp;c des Chinois, par les missionaries de Pekin</em>, which I read in the article <a href="https://pinyin.info/readings/texts/ideographic_myth.html"><em>The ideographic myth</em></a>.↩︎</p></li>
