A mind well aware of the mathematical\n  relevance of his fresh ideas. Years of frustration under self-imposed labels.\n  _Misunderstood_. _Ahead of his time_. The eve of a fatal duel. A mathematical\n  testament. A _coquette de bas étage_. Infatuation. A gunshot. An everlasting\n  romanticized entry in the history books.\n\nThat's the story you've heard, isn't it?\n\nHistory is harder. The figure of [Évariste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois)\nas a precocious mind is undeniable. These stories are great engagements into\nmathematics, but are often exaggerated or fantasized. We'll shortly try to\nget these down to earth in this introduction.\n\nRevolutionary mathematics. Évariste Galois essentially gave birth to two\nbig branches of mathematics, group theory and Galois theory. What an unexpected\nname for the second one, right? We will soon start getting our hands dirty\nwith the same mathematics that were driving the passion of a young Galois,\nand then *you* will have to judge whether they were really _revolutionary\nmathematics_. You will try to actively approach his life through his mathematics.\n\nGalois had a short life. He died at the age of 20. Despite this short life,\nhe wrote his arguably most important paper (the one which showcases his\n_revolutionary_ ideas and often referred to as the _first memoir_) four years\nbefore his death, roughly at the age of 17. This is of course far from the\ncommon belief of him writing down all his theory just the night prior to his\ndeath. My intention in this post is going through this first memoir, to\nintroduce you to Galois' ideas as close as possible to how he himself viewed\nthem back then. We will start doing this after a few shamefully long but I \nbelieve necessary motivation sections.\n\nPointless death. _But why did he die so young?_ Ah, yes, these mathematicians\nneeding some love and doing anything in their hands when they get a chance.\nAnd let's just throw in [some Reddit jokes\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13ycbnu/til_that_%C3%A9variste_galois_a_math_prodigy_who/)\nbecause why not. In reality, this is an obscure part of Galois' life and we \ncan't really tell for sure what happened. If you think dying in a duel for \nthe woman you love is weird, wait until I tell you about this one. \n\nIn some accounts they say Galois staged his death. He was so involved into\npolitics that he was willing to give his own life to the republicans, so\nthat his death would help starting a riot and eventually, another revolution.\nI don't know if you find this more believable than the love duel... But \nthere's some logic here. In his last letters, Galois was talking about his\nown death like it was something unavoidable. You tell me, if you were really\ngoing out there for a duel, you would try as hard as possible to win and thus \nlive, right? You're only sure about your death if you're not willing to try \nin the first place.\n\nThis theory seems more reasonable to me, but who cares about my opinion?\nYou can also have your own. Anyway, if this one was really the plan, history\nwas evil. The riots on Galois' death were supposed to start at his funeral, but\njust one day after his death, the one of the well-known [general Lamarque\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Maximilien_Lamarque) followed. These news\ncompletely eclipsed those of the not so broadly known mathematician. Lamarque's\ndeath did start a rebellion, but was soon stopped. If we look back at Galois,\nthis was, indeed, a _pointless death_.\n\nThe ideas that originally led to the creation of new branches of math thanks to \nGalois can be summarized in a short phrase. _The study of solutions of\npolynomial equations_. If I give you an equation like $x^{3} + 5x - 2 = 0$,\ncan you find out which values of $x$ satisfy this relation? This question\nquickly evolves into a more intriguing one... _Can I always write down a formula\nfor the solutions of any equation you give me?_ These are the sort of questions\nGalois and his math predecessors were interested in. Despite finding remarkable\nanswers at such an early age, we shouldn't feel discouraged. We should rather \nreframe our view. _If the most basic form of this theory was originally\ndeveloped by a high schooler, what prevents me from understanding it?_ As for\nalmost anything, I think this barrier is just _hard work_. I like to think\nthat Galois' sleepless nights immersed into his mathematics speak for themselves.\n\nWe're going to follow Galois on this journey.\n\nYou'll have to _do_ mathematics. \n\n# First degree\n\nHere’s one for my kindergarten fans out there. Can you solve this equation?\n\n$$ \n  x + a = 0\n$$\n\n_What's $x$?_\n\n_What's $a$?_\n\n...\n\nJust kidding.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: Subtract $a$ from both sides... And try clicking me!\n\nYou might see boxes like this one throughout the article. If they have\nan arrow at the right end, it means they have hidden content and you can\nexpand to see it by clicking on them.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning. Writing a blog with aesthetically pleasant math\nformulas is totally not easy. They have to look good in all kinds of devices.\nFor this reason, the safest workaround so that I don't risk someone seeing\nabsolute rubbish is to use horizontal scroll bars when the formula might\notherwise overflow the screen. This will rarely appear on a large monitor\nbut will be quite frequent in mobile devices, and I think there's no way\nto force a scroll bar actually showing on mobile browsers, so I had to warn\nyou. If you feel like a formula is going out of the screen, please try to\nscroll it even if you don't see a scroll bar! Here, an example:\n\n$$ \n  \\text{I am not one of those who fear to die, and I will not go quietly to the grave without telling the truth. My life's work will be understood in time. I have studied the theory of equations not as an isolated discipline but as part of a grander vision — the theory of groups. This new approach will illuminate the roots of algebraic problems and forever change mathematics. Though my life may be brief, my ideas will live on.}\n$$ \n\n\n:::\n\n\n# Second degree\n\n## I know that one\n\nOur _good ol'_ friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations...\nOk, yeah, they didn't formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them.\nFor us, this is a second degree equation:\n\n$$ \n  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\n$$ \n\nNow it's your time to shine... You do remember that formula you were forced to\nmemorize in high school, don't you? Yes!\n\n$$ \n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}  }{2a}\n$$ \n\nHuh...\n\nThis is supposed to be an entry to [Summer of Math Exposition #4](https://some.3b1b.co/prize).\nIf you check this link, you'll find one part that goes like this:\n\n> **Most Frequently Requested Topics**\n>\n> Foundation-Level Concepts (Ages 11-16):\n>\n> 1. Variables and algebra - Students don't understand that \"x\" represents an unknown value to find\n>\n> ...\n\nWell, well, we just started and I'm already digging my own pit. I think I'll just wait for\nsomeone else to address that in a whole post. If you happen to be one of those confused\nstudents and you end up here, well, good luck with that. You have all your time. Don't\nthink the post will be an _easy_ read. But as for the prerequisites, I don't expect\nfrom you anything more than the algebra and complex numbers you were taught in high school.\n\nWhile you probably knew the above formula with the coefficients $a, b, c$ just like that,\nI'm going to be using the same letter with subscripts, where $a_i$ is the coefficient\nof the term $x^{i}$. Moreover, note that the coefficient $a_n$ of the highest degree term\n(here $a_2$) is useless: the equation obtained from dividing everything by that\ncoefficient will have the same roots.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Why are the roots the same?\n\nIf $x_1$ is a solution of $a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, then we have:\n\n$$ \n  a_2 x_1^{2} + a_1 x_1 + a_0 = 0\n$$ \n\nBut zero divided by any number will still be zero, so we have:\n\n$$ \n  \\frac{1}{a_2} \\cdot (a_2 x_1^{2} + a_1 x_1 + a_0) = \\frac{1}{a_2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$ \n\nThis is the same as:\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{2} + \\frac{a_1}{a_2} x + \\frac{a_0}{a_2} = 0\n$$ \n\nThis last relation exactly means that $x_1$ is also a solution of the new\nequation, which has no coefficient for the $x^{2}$ term.\n\n:::\n\nSo the equation we'll work with looks like this:\n\n$$ \n  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\n$$ \n\nWe haven't talked about which values can the coefficients of the equation take.\nWe could decide that they can be _any natural number_ ($0, 1, 2\\dots$), _any integer_\n($0, 1, -1, 2, -2\\dots$), _any rational_... From now on, we'll assume they're\nrational numbers. \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# What's a rational number?\n\nThis is just a fancy term for fractions, the result of dividing\none integer by another. They are things like $0, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{57}{3}, -2$...\nOf course, integers are also rationals because any integer $a$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{1}$.\n\n:::\n\nAnd why not choosing, say, just integers? Because we need some freedom with\nthe operations we do with coefficients. When we talked about dividing everything\nby $a_2$, we were already considering that the new coefficients had to be at\nleast rational. Otherwise, depending on which division we perform, if we had\nintegers initially, we could now end up with something that isn't an integer\nanymore. Thus, if we choose rational coefficients we're allowed to do basic\noperations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with them and always be sure that\nthe result will still be a rational number.\n\n> It's dividing fractions... What's dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?\n>\n> — _Only yesterday_ (1991)\n\nNo, I'm not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an\nexcuse to include a part of [one of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/film/only-yesterday/),\nwhere Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand \nthe logic behind dividing fractions. _Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it\nlike that?_ This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception.\nI also feel like this, even while doing my research to write this post.\nMany suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it,\nmeaning that you shouldn't force yourself too far to get the logic behind some\nconcepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While\nI do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I\nwill try my best in this article to build some intuition.\n\nSo just for the last time, let's rewrite the equation and the solution with the new\nletters...\n\n$$ \n  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \\text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$ are rationals}\n$$ \n\n$$ \n  x = \\frac{-a_1 \\pm \\sqrt{a_1^{2} -4 a_0} }{2}\n$$ \n\n## But how did you get there?\n\n_Shut up and memorize!_\n\nJust joking. Let's see what we can do...\n\nIn the previous section we talked about equations and solutions. We might\nsometimes still use that terminology, but we're also going to talk about\npolynomials and roots. For our purposes, an equation can be expressed as\n$p(x) = 0$, where $p(x)$ is a polynomial. In the quadratic example, the\npolynomial would be $p(x) = x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$. A root of the polynomial\nis any value that gives an output of $0$ when plugged as $x$ into that\npolynomial. Therefore, a solution of the equation is a root of the polynomial.\n\nSuppose we give names $x_1$, $x_2$ to our hypothetical roots. If something\nis a root, as we just said, it should evaluate the polynomial to $0$. This\nmust work for both roots, so when factored out, the polynomial should look\nlike $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$. Here, if we change $x$ by either $x_1$ or $x_2$,\nthe result will be $0$ as expected. Can you express the coefficients $a_1$\nand $a_0$ in terms of the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$? \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: try expanding the product $(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$\n\nLet's expand the product:\n\n$$ \n  (x - x_1) (x - x_2) = x^{2} + (- x_1 - x_2) x + x_1 x_2\n$$\n\nBut considering the original polynomial looked like $x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$,\nthat means we have the following equalities for our roots:\n\n$$\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2   &= a_0\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$\n\n:::\n\nThe cool thing about these relations is that the result of adding or multiplying\nthe roots is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals),\neven if the roots themselves might not be rational. \nIn fact, knowing that, any weird expression made up of sums and products of roots, say\n$\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^{3}}{3x_1 x_2} -4(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 x_2)^{6}$, will be _rationally\nknown_. I'm using these words on purpose, because that's how Galois\nhimself referred to quantities that ultimately evaluate to a rational number, even\nif the operands themselves aren't necessarily rationals (like our roots). Keep this\ncool observation in mind, you'll see why in just a while. \n\nSo we have to figure out a formula for both roots. They're just two now, yes, but\nyou know this is going further, right? We will work with higher degree equations later.\nWouldn't it be cool if we could just find the value of _one_ thing, and then get\nthe value of all roots _for free_ just from that? Of course, besides this weird value,\nwe're also allowed to use the original coefficients of the polynomial or any other\nknown numbers.\n\nI'll help you with that. There are probably a lot of values we could choose to find,\nbut I'll give you this one:\n\n$$ \n  t = x_1 - x_2\n$$ \n\nOf course you're now supposed to check that this does _encode_ everything about\nthe roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Can you write them in terms of $t$?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: use also $-a_1 = x_1 + x_2$\n\nRemember learning how to solve systems of equations in high school? Reduction\nmethod, is that you?\n\n$$ \n  \\left.\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\\\\n      -a_1 &= x_1 + x_2\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right\\}\n  \\Rightarrow\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - t}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nDo you see where this is going? Of course, we'll now try to find the value of $t$!\nBut why would this be easier? \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: try to find the value of $t^{2}$ first\n\nWell, instead of computing $t$, let's try with $t^{2}$:\n\n$$ \n  t^{2} = (x_1 - x_2)^{2} = x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} - 2 x_1 x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^{2} - 4 x_1 x_2 \n  \\overset{\\text{cool obs.}}{=} a_1^{2} - 4 a_0\n$$\n\nYou do know what happened in the last step, right? The cool observation we made\nearlier. We put everything in terms of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1 x_2$, so we can then\nuse the known rational coefficients, and we're done. We know what $t^{2}$ is, so\nwe can now pick a square root and have $t = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4a_0}$. \n\n:::\n\nNow that we know the value of $t$, getting back the values of the original\nroots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is routine substitution in the equalities we stated\nearlier.\n\nBut before claiming our trophy in the form of a final result, let's expand our perspective\na bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we're sure that $t$ is a root, and we\nknow how to solve this new equation. That way we would get the value of $t$, just like\nabove, hoping that it would be easier than trying to solve the original equation.\n\nSo... How does such an equation look like? The one I'll show you won't be\ntoo surprising, and you'll even think I'm just making fun of you, but keep in\nmind I'm trying to prepare a recipe for future sections. Alright, the equation:\n\n$$ \n  (x - t)(x + t) = 0\n$$\n\nOf course this equation makes sense. We already made a useful observation before.\nIf $t$ has to be a root, there must be a factor like $(x - t)$ out there.\nThe reason we also included $(x + t)$ is that now this product will give a neat\nresult, as you might expect from before. Yes, we just happen to know that because\nwe already calculated $t^{2}$ before, and this seems to be some circular\nreasoning, but bear with me, this will be a useful reinterpretation later...\n\n$$ \n\\begin{array}{c}\n  (x - t)(x + t) = 0 \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x^{2} - t^{2} = 0 \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x^{2} = t^{2} \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x = \\sqrt{t^{2}} = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0} = t\n\\end{array}\n$$ \n\nAt this point you might be wondering why I never bother to write the typical sign\n$\\pm$ to represent that we could take either the positive or the negative value,\nin this case, when taking the square root. At least for our quadratic example,\nthis is irrelevant! Why? Well, you just look back at the relations:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - t}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\nIf we take the positive value, that is, $t = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then we\nget the solutions:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\nIf we instead take the negative value, i.e., $t = -\\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then our\nsolutions will be:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 - \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 + \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\nThey're the same but swapped! So who cares? We just wanted to find the roots\nin the first place, we didn't even define what should be called $x_1$ and what $x_2$,\nthere's just no difference. This also somehow addresses another question you might\nhave had. We want to find the value of the root $t$ from the new equation. _But how\ndo we even know which one of the roots is $t$?_ Well, as we just said, it turns out\nany of them works... The more general answer to this question isn't that easy,\nbut will play a crucial role in our understanding of these equations, and we'll\nget back to it later. _No spoilers_.\n\n# First symmetry\n\nI bet you know what's coming next... But before we try to tame that naughty cubic\nequation, we need some polynomial machinery. We'll find some symmetries along\nthe way, I hope you're excited!\n\nLet's recall the cool observation from previous section:\n\n$$\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2   &= a_0\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$\n\nThe question is obvious... Can we find something similar for the cubic equation?\n\n$$ \n  x^{3} + a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \\text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$ are rationals}\n$$ \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Yes we can! Hint: expand $(x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_3)$\n\nWe proceed the same way as for the quadratic. If the roots are $x_1$, $x_2$ and\n$x_3$, we should be able to factor the equation like $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)$.\nWhat do we get from here? You can check it yourself:\n\n$$ \n  (x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3) = x^{3} - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) x^{2} + (x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3) x - x_1 x_2 x_3\n$$ \n\nWe got our relations!\n\n$$\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= -a_2 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 &= a_1 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 x_3 &= -a_0\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$\n\n:::\n\nI know you're seeing the pattern for the coefficients:\n\n- Sum of all roots, negative sign\n- Sum of all products of two different roots, positive sign\n- Sum of all products of three different roots, negative sign\n- ...\n\nNow pay attention to this. If we have an equation of degree $n$, in coefficient\n$a_i$, we have all possible different ways of choosing $n-i$ roots. What happens\nif we swap any two of the roots? Of course, nothing! We rearranged some sums\nand products, but since the order doesn't matter, and we were including all\npossible products, we still have the same result! We say that these expressions\nare _symmetric_ polynomials. A polynomial on the roots $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$\nis _symmetric_ if it doesn't change no matter how we rearrange the roots.\n\nThe symmetric polynomials we've been working with actually have a special name:\nthey're called _elementary symmetric polynomials_. Just to make it clear, the\n_elementary symmetric polynomials_ we've seen so far are the following: \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# For two roots\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# For three roots\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 x_3\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Guess the ones for four roots\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_4 + x_1 x_3 x_4 + x_2 x_3 x_4 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nAny guess for why they're called _elementary_? I'll give you a few examples to think.\n\nLet's take for example this polynomial:\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2}\n$$ \n\nIt is obviously symmetric, since all three terms are squared and the order \nof the sum doesn't matter. However, it's not an _elementary symmetric\npolynomial_ itself, because it doesn't fit the pattern we introduced above.\n\nCan we actually know its value? Let's rewrite it...\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: try to relate this value with $(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^{2}$\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2} = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^{2} - 4(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3) = a_2^{2} - 4 a_1\n$$ \n\nYes! That's a known rational number.\n\n:::\n\nLet's try another symmetric polynomial:\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{3} x_2 + x_2^{3} x_3 + x_3^{3} x_1\n$$ \n\n_Oops!_ This is not a symmetric polynomial! Can you see why? It needs a small fix:\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{3} x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2^{3} x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_3^{3}\n$$ \n\nYes, much better now. Can you prove this one is indeed symmetric? Hint: it's\nenough to check swaps of two roots. That's because any rearrangement of roots\ncan be explained as a series of swaps of two roots. Now, is this also a known value?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: is this a product of two familiar expressions...?\n\n$$ \n  x_1^{3} x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2^{3} x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_3^{3} = (x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2} )(x_1 x_2 x_3) = (a_2^{2} -4 a_1) \\cdot (-a_0)\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nWell, this one also worked. Do you see where I'm going?\n\nWe were already observing in a previous section that any expression written\nin terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials has a known rational value,\nno matter how complicated the expression may be. An expression written in terms\nof elementary symmetric polynomials is of course symmetric, because each of\nthese terms is. But can we go further? \n\n_Any symmetric polynomial can be written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials._ \n\nI hope you agree this is not obvious at all. And the statement just like that\ndoesn't seem too interesting. Because we know that elementary symmetric\npolynomials are known rational numbers, then we get this more insightful\nresult for free:\n\n_Any symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number._ \n\nWe'll use this result a few times later. Of course, we should prove the first\nstatement about elementary symmetric polynomials. In Galois' time, this was\nsuch a well-known fact that he didn't even bother including it in the\nprerequisites for his memoir. \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Why is this true?\n\nTODO: sketch of proof\n\n:::\n\n\n# Third degree\n\n## Déjà vu\n\nTime for the cubic!

For the quadratic\nwe used $t = x_1 - x_2$. Can we find such a value for the cubic?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n## Hint: Can you use the solutions of the equation $x^{3} = 1$?\n\nYes we can! Did you think about complex roots of unity? If you like following\nthe pattern, for the quadratic we have $t = \\alpha_1 x_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2$\nwhere $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$ are the solutions of the equation $x^{2} = 1$. These\nare of course $1$ and $-1$.\n\nWhat are the solutions of $x^{3} = 1$? They're $1$, $\\omega$ and $\\omega^{2}$,\nwhere $\\omega$ is a complex root of $x^{2} + x + 1 = 0$. Then, again just\nfollowing the pattern, we could think of the following special value:\n\n$$ \n  t = x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3\n$$ \n\nThis is just a hunch! In order to use this, we should actually show that all\n$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ can be expressed in terms of this $t$ and other known values.\n\n:::\n\nNow that we got the value, it's time to show that the roots can be expressed\nin terms of this $t$... Or that's what I thought while writing this. Too optimistic...\nI'm not saying it's not possible, but it can be quite difficult to get those\nformulas. Instead of trying to narrow down to a single value $t$, let's try\nfor a moment to use two values, the other being very similar to $t$. I'll help\nyou with this one.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Check these relations\n\n$$ \n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  t &= x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 \\\\\n  t' &= x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 + \\omega x_3 \\\\\n  -a_2 &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nCan you now find the roots by using $t$, $t'$, $\\omega$ and the coefficients?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: Can you use the fact that $1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0$?\n\nWe can try to sum all three equations multiplied by specific coefficients\nso that our root remains there and the other two are cancelled out\nà la reduction method, because of the given relation of $\\omega$.\n\nDoing that, we get these formulas for the roots:\n\n$$ \n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 &= \\frac{t + t' - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_2 &= \\frac{\\omega^{2} t + \\omega t' - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_3 &= \\frac{\\omega t + \\omega^{2} t' - a_2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n$$\n\n:::\n\nOK, so we can get the roots by using both $t$ and $t'$. Yes, I know what\nyou're thinking. We now have to find two values instead of one, but trust\nme, this is justified, since these values seem so similar that I hope\nwe'll be able to find both of them _at the same time_.\n\nYou already know how this goes, now we have to build a polynomial for which\n$t$ is a root, and hopefully, just hopefully, $t'$ will also be one of its\nroots. Let's recall, or rather expand, the way we built the polynomial for\nthe quadratic case. I told you it would be helpful later, and the time has come.\n\nRemember that we had $t = x_1 - x_2$. Our special polynomial for the quadratic\nwas this:\n\n$$ \n  (x - t)(x + t) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x + (x_1 - x_2)) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x - (x_2 - x_1))\n  = x^{2} - ((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1)) x + (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)\n$$ \n\nYou already know what the actual polynomial is, but I left it in this last form\nto notice something: the coefficients are symmetric polynomials on the roots!\nIf you try swapping $x_1$ and $x_2$ in both expressions $((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1))$\nand $(x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)$, you get the same result. In the previous section,\nwe just saw that all symmetric polynomials on the roots are actually known values.\nThey're made from the coefficients of the original equation, which were rational,\nso we got a new equation with rational coefficients. \n\nOf course, there _is_ one concern. Perhaps this new equation is just as hard to\nsolve as the original one, and then we did something completely useless. While\nthat's a possibility, we were hoping that our choice of $t$ would make the new\nequation sufficiently easy to solve. In the case of the quadratic, you know that\nthis was true because we were able to lose the term of $x$, and get a simpler\nquadratic $x^{2} - t^{2} = 0$, which only requires to take a square root to solve.\n\nWe saw the coefficients we got in the end are symmetric polynomials, but we could\nhave deduced that from the start, from the way we defined the polynomial as a\nproduct. Yes, in the quadratic example it was easier to see why we would benefit\nfrom choosing both $t$ and $-t$ (sum times difference is the difference of squares).\nAnother way to look at this is that $-t$ is the result of swapping the roots in $t$:\n\n$$ \n  (x - (\\text{t with no swaps}))(x - (\\text{t with roots swapped}))\n$$ \n\nThis form is telling us that this is a symmetric polynomial _on the roots_, and\ntherefore, that its final coefficients will be known rational values. Can you see\nwhy? I'll let you figure that out, because now it's your turn again... Can you\nuse this idea to find a suitable new polynomial for the cubic, for which $t$ and\n$t'$ are two of its roots? Just to remember, these are their expressions:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 \\\\\n      t' &= x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 + \\omega x_3\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n  \\quad\n  \\text{The value $\\omega$ is such that $1+\\omega+\\omega^{2} = 0$}\n$$ \n\nCome on, try to find the polynomial!\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: Why is the quadratic example a symmetric polynomial on its roots?\n\nWe defined it as the product of two terms. Note that the order of the product\ndoesn't matter. What happens to the expression if we swap the roots $x_1$ and\n$x_2$? Then we get:\n\n$$ \n  (x - (\\text{t with roots swapped}))(x - (\\text{t with no swaps}))\n$$ \n\nAnd this is certainly the same polynomial. For the quadratic, all the possible\nrearrangements are only swapping both roots or leaving them the same way. Since\nall these rearrangements give the same polynomial, we can say the polynomial is\nsymmetric in the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Do you see how this helps for the cubic?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: You'll get a wild expression for the cubic, but try to simplify as much as possible.\n\nThe previous hint talked about _all rearrangements_ of the roots. This should\nalready be a really good hint. Yes, we're doing exactly that. Let's start from $t$\nand find all possible expressions that come from rearrangements of $x_1$, $x_2$\nand $x_3$ in $t$:\n\n$$ \n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 &= t \\\\\n  x_1 + \\omega x_3 + \\omega^{2} x_2 &= t' \\\\\n  x_3 + \\omega x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 &= \\omega t \\\\\n  x_2 + \\omega x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_3 &= \\omega t' \\\\\n  x_2 + \\omega x_3 + \\omega^{2} x_1 &= \\omega^{2} t \\\\\n  x_3 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_1 &= \\omega^{2} t'\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n$$ \n\nThere are quite some things going on there, so you'd better pause and check\nthose relations hold. Note that we also included $t'$ in there! We now see\nthat $t'$ was just one of the expressions obtained from the rearrangements of\nthe roots in $t$. Of course, now we'll build a polynomial that has all of these\nas roots, so in particular it will have both $t$ and $t'$ as roots, just like\nwe wanted! The reason I wrote the equalities above is so that we now don't\nhave to write the absolute beast that this polynomial would be as a product.\nWe will instead just write the right side of the equalities:\n\n$$ \n  (x - t)(x - t')(x - \\omega t)(x - \\omega t')(x - \\omega^{2} t)(x - \\omega^{2} t')\n$$ \n\nOh, yeah, we're going to have fun trying to simplify this... But by now we\nshould know that, no matter how complicated it looks, in the end, this should\nbe a polynomial with rational coefficients. It's a symmetric polynomial on the\nroots, _we_ made it like that by multiplying all rearrangements of roots.\n\nWhat happens if we try to multiply only those terms having $t$? I'll let\nyou check that, but the product simplifies nicely because of the relations\n$1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0$ and $\\omega^{3} = 1$:\n\n$$ \n  (x - t)(x - \\omega t)(x - \\omega^{2} t) = x^{3} - t^{3}\n$$ \n\nWe can of course do the same with the terms involving $t'$:\n\n$$ \n  (x - t')(x - \\omega t')(x - \\omega^{2} t') = x^{3} - t'^{3}\n$$ \n\nSo because of the useful relations that we got from the roots of unity, our\nproduct simplified into this much cleaner expression:\n\n$$ \n  (x^{3} - t^{3})(x^{3} - t'^{3})\n$$ \n:::\n\nYes, we still have some work to do to simplify that... \n\n\n## I ain't doing that\n\nI really like these _boxes_ that help hiding _spoilers_ and try to encourage\nyou, my dear lazy reader, to work through some of the steps on your own. Of\ncourse, we can't hide everything inside these boxes and the text must keep\nflowing. I'll now have to show how the polynomial we were looking for in the\nprevious section looks like, but I'm showing a simplified expression. The\nmoral of the story is that the _spoiler_ isn't the polynomial itself, because\nit's simplified. The real _spoiler_ is the series of steps you needed to get\nthere! Remember we're trying to build intuition.\n\nAnd in fact, we already got a lot of intuition from the previous section!\nThis section is only meant to show you that we can actually end and\nget the solutions of the cubic, although it's more of a rutinary calculation\nfrom here on. You and me are both lazy human beings that don't bother doing\nthose mundane calculations, do we? Let's see what we can do...\n\nWe left at this point:\n\n$$ \n  (x^{3} - t^{3})(x^{3} - t'^{3})\n$$ \n\nWe can expand that product and get this:\n\n$$ \n  x^{6} - (t^{3} + t'^{3}) x^{3} + t^{3} t'^{3}\n$$ \n\nSee, the values $t^{3}$ and $t'^{3}$ don't have to be rationals themselves,\nbut since this came from a symmetric polynomial on the roots, the coefficients\nmust be rationals! And we want to try solving a polynomial with known\ncoefficients... OK, OK, you don't have to calculate those coefficients if you\ndon't want to. I'll tell you what they really are, but we'll give them short\nnames $u$ and $v$ for a while after that:\n\n$$ \n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  u &= t^{3} + t'^{3} = - 27 a_{0} + 9 a_{1} a_{2} - 2 a_{2}^{3} \\\\\n  v &= t^{3} t'^{3} = (- 3 a_{1} + a_{2}^{2})^{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n$$\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# So you still want to know how I got them...\n\nLet the computer do the boring stuff for you!

The six possible solutions! Which ones are\n$t$ and $t'$? Unfortunately, in this case, we can't just choose any combination.\n\nBy now I think it's time we get rid of $t'$. How come?

How do we know which root of the new\npolynomial is the $t$ we want? Of course, we could always try all six\npossible values in these equations for $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$, and double\ncheck if they really are solutions of the original cubic equation. \n\nWill you do that for me? Well...\n\nBefore we die in the attempt, let's try to give some short expressions for all\nsix roots. We will fix one of them and get the others in terms of that one. We'll\ncall this one $t$, but this is just a name for a fixed root, it could be any of\nthem. Suppose then that $t$ is this:\n\n$$\n  t = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{u + \\sqrt{u^{2} - 4v}}{2}} \n$$\n\nWhen taking cube roots, one way of writing all three of them is to fix one and\nmultiply by roots of unity to get the others (because of course you get the same\nif you again raise to the third power). That means another two roots are $\\omega t$\nand $\\omega^{2} t$. \n\nWhat about the other three? We should take the negative sign for the square root\ninside. If we call that one $t'$, we then have the relation we defined earlier:\n\n$$ \n  t \\cdot t' = k \\Rightarrow t' = \\frac{k}{t} \\quad \\text{where } k = -3 a_1 + a_2^{2}\n$$ \n\nSo another root is $\\frac{k}{t}$. Since there's also a cube root there, we can\npick another two roots to be $\\omega \\frac{k}{t}$ and $\\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t}$.\nSo after fixing one root $t$, all six of them can be expressed like this:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{ \n  t, \\omega t, \\omega ^{2} t, \\frac{k}{t}, \\omega \\frac{k}{t}, \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t} \n  \\right\\}\n$$ \n\nRemember this $t$ was just some fixed root. If we use this one, in the equations\nabove for the roots, we would get $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ in that order. That's\nbasically just the definition.

I'm a bit tired of writing monstrous equations though. We'll\ntry with a specific example, of which we could even know the roots in advance.\nRemember this is just a sort of thought experiment. OK, so our cubic equation\nwill be this:\n\n$$ \n  x^{3} - x^{2} - x - 2 = 0\n$$ \n\nWe can quickly check if there is an integer solution by only trying the values\n$\\pm 1, \\pm 2$ for $x$. Maybe you even recall doing this in high school!\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Can you see why?\n\nWe can rewrite the equation like this:\n\n$$ \n  x \\cdot (x^{2} - x - 1) = 2\n$$ \n\nIf $x$ was an integer, we would have $x \\cdot \\text{other integer} = 2$,\nso $x$ must be a divisor of $2$. The only possible values would then be\n$\\pm 1, \\pm 2$.\n\n:::\n\nIt turns out that $x = 2$ is a valid solution (you can verify it). That means\nthe cubic polynomial will have a factor $(x-2)$. Were you told how to perform\npolynomial long division? If so, go ahead, factor this cubic! If not, don't\nworry, we have some workarounds. We can try to write the factorization like this:\n\n$$ \n  x^{3} - x^{2} -x - 2 = (x-2)(x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0)\n$$ \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Can you find $a_1$ and $a_0$? Hint: expand the product and compare coefficients\n\n$$ \n  x^{3} + (a_1 - 2) x^{2} + (a_0 - 2 a_1) x - 2 a_0\n$$ \n\nFollowing the coefficients of the original polynomial, we must have $-2 a_0 = -2$,\nso $a_0 = 1$. Likewise, $a_1 - 2 = -1$, so $a_1 = 1$. These also give the expected\nresult for $a_0 - 2 a_1 = -1$, so we got the coefficients. The factorization is then:\n\n$$ \n  x^{3} - x^{2} - x - 2 = (x-2)(x^{2} + x + 1) = (x-2)(x-\\omega)(x-\\omega^{2})\n$$\n\nWe also know the last equality! The polynomial $x^{2} + x + 1$ is already familiar\nto us, and we defined its solutions as $\\omega$ and $\\omega^{2}$.\n\n:::\n\nSo we now know the three solutions of this equation. We're cheating! Who cares?\nLet's try a different special value! If you recall, we used $t = x_1 - x_2$ for\nthe quadratic equation. Well, let's just try it with the cubic as well, and see\nwhat happens.\n\nSuppose we like defining $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = \\omega$, $x_3 = \\omega^{2}$. Then we\ncan have these relations:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\\\\n      \\frac{7}{t} &= x_1 - x_3 \\\\\n      1 &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Where did those come from?\n\nThe first one is just the current definition for $t$. The last one comes from\nthe coefficient relation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -a_2$ we already saw in a previous\nsection. The second one comes from a product:\n\n$$ \n  (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3) = (2 - \\omega)(2 - \\omega^{2}) = 4 -2\\omega -2\\omega^{2} + \\omega^{3} = 6 - 2 (1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2}) + 1 = 7\n$$ \n\nThen we have\n\n$$ \n  (x_1 - x_3) = \\frac{7}{x_1 - x_2} = \\frac{7}{t}\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nUsing the above relations, can you obtain all roots in terms of $t$?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n# Hint: Use reduction method!\n\nAs in other examples, this is a matter of summing all equations, each one\nmultiplied by a certain number to cancel out the roots we don't want. After\nyou find the correct numbers you get:\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    x_1 &= \\frac{t + \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3} \\\\ \n    x_2 &= \\frac{-2t + \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3} \\\\ \n    x_3 &= \\frac{t - 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nYes! It turns out we can use a different special value, and still be able to\nencode the information of all roots. Now that we have the roots in terms of $t$,\nwe only need the values of $t$. You know what to do now, don't you? The new\nequation from which we get the values of $t$ is that one with products of all\npossible rearrangements of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ in $t$. Since we're cheating\nand we already know the roots of the original polynomial, we can save ourselves\nfrom building that new polynomial monstrosity and directly write down all its\nsix roots. In case you're a bit lost, I'll tell you the first one, which comes\nfrom no rearrangement: $t = x_1 - x_2 = 2 - \\omega$.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Which are the rearrangements?\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    t &= x_1 - x_2 = 2 - \\omega \\\\\n    \\frac{7}{t} &= x_1 - x_3 = 2 - \\omega^{2} \\\\\n    -t &= x_2 - x_1 = \\omega - 2 \\\\\n    -\\frac{7}{t} &= x_3 - x_1 = \\omega^{2} - 2 \\\\\n    -t + \\frac{7}{t} &= x_2 - x_3 = \\omega - \\omega^{2} \\\\\n    t - \\frac{7}{t} &= x_3 - x_2 = \\omega^{2} - \\omega\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\nThe right side of each equation is the actual rearrangement of the roots. I only\nwrote the left side to show you they can be written in terms of $t$, and in case\nthese alternative expressions are useful to you to more easily plug them into\nthe root relations to calculate $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$.\n\n:::\n\nNow for the final step! Let's try to get those roots back from the values of $t$.\nI said values in plural on purpose. In the general cubic, we somehow got the\nstriking result that all values of $t$ are valid because they just give back\na different arrangement of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$. Here we're interested in\nseeing if this still holds for a different special value $t$. Alright, I'll\nalso include this one in a spoiler just in case you're in the mood for some\ncalculations.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# Find the roots for each possible value of $t$\n\n$$ \n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    t = 2 - \\omega &\\mapsto (2, \\omega, \\omega^{2}) \\\\\n    \\frac{7}{t} = 2 - \\omega^{2} &\\mapsto (2, \\omega^{2}, \\omega) \\\\\n    -t = \\omega - 2 &\\mapsto \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2}{3} - \\omega, \\frac{5}{3} + \\omega \\right) \\\\\n    -\\frac{7}{t} = \\omega^{2} - 2 &\\mapsto \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2}{3} - \\omega^{2}, \\frac{5}{3} + \\omega^{2} \\right) \\\\\n    -t + \\frac{7}{t} = \\omega - \\omega^{2} &\\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{13}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{17}{9}(\\omega - \\omega^{2})\\right) \\\\\n    t - \\frac{7}{t} = \\omega^{2} - \\omega &\\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{13}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{17}{9}(\\omega - \\omega^{2})\\right)\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nHuh... What is this absolute rubbish? We expected some neat rearrangements of\nthe roots $2$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^{2}$, and, well, we got that for the first\ntwo possible values of $t$, but we got some ugly results for the others...\nUnfortunately, we'll have to conclude from this that not all solutions of the\nnew equation can be used to get the solutions of the original one.\n\nBut we can certainly use _some_ of them. You see, the ones corresponding to\n$2 - \\omega = t$ and $2 - \\omega^{2} = \\frac{7}{t}$ did give the intended\nsolutions. Now the next question should be: _Is there some rule to know exactly\nwhich solutions of the new equation do retrieve the solutions for the original\none?_\n\nIn this case, let's consider a smaller part of the new equation. Let's compute\nthe product of only those two factors including the roots that worked:\n\n$$ \n  (x - (2 - \\omega))(x - (2 - \\omega^{2})) = x^{2} -(2 - \\omega + 2 - \\omega^{2})x + (2-\\omega)(2-\\omega^{2})\n$$ \n\nIn fact, this is already a polynomial with known coefficients! The coefficient\nfor $x$ simplifies thanks to $1+\\omega+\\omega^{2} = 0$, and we already computed\nthe product $(2-\\omega)(2-\\omega^{2})$ before. The polynomial is then:\n\n$$ \n  x^{2} -3x + 7\n$$\n\nThe whole point of computing a huge product of all rearrangements was that we\nwere sure the resulting polynomial would have known coefficients. We didn't\nexpect that, at least in this case, a smaller polynomial containing $t$ would\nalready have known coefficients. We could already find $t$ from this even\neasier polynomial, since it's just quadratic. And thanks to our half-failure\nfrom before, we also know that the other four roots were completely useless.\n\nFollowing on that idea, remember when we factored the original polynomial\nbecause one of the roots was an integer. The other part would then be\n$x^{2} + x + 1$, and we know from quadratics that $x_2 + x_3 = -1$ and\n$x_2 \\cdot x_3 = 1$. In the [First symmetry](first-symmetry) section we\nlearned that:\n\n_Any symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number._\n\nIn this example, because of the root $x_1$ already being rational, we can\nuse the same reasoning for only the other two roots, so we can be even\nmore specific:\n\n_Any symmetric polynomial on the roots $x_2$ and $x_3$ is a known number._\n\nThis shows that, at least sometimes, if we confirm a polynomial on the roots\nis unchanged by some of the rearrangements, not necessarily all of them, we\ncan already be sure that its result is a known number.\n\nWhat about the other way around? If we know a polynomial on the roots is a\nknown number, will it always be unchanged by those specific rearrangements?\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n# In our specific example, the answer is yes! Why?\n\nAny polynomial on the roots $x_2 = \\omega$ and $x_3 = \\omega^{2}$ can actually\nbe written as $a + b \\omega$, where $a$ and $b$ are rationals. How? We can just\nrewrite $\\omega^{2}$ as $-1 -\\omega$ because of the relation\n$1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0$, and then group all terms based on whether they\nmultiply an $\\omega$ or not.\n\nIf the polynomial is written like that, then being a known rational value means\nthat $b$ must be an expression that simplifies to zero. This again means that\nswapping $\\omega$ and $\\omega^{2}$ in this expression doesn't change the\nresult, since that would only change $a + b \\omega$ to $a + b \\omega^{2}$,\nbut we still have $b$ simplifying to zero anyway.\n\n:::\n\nSo what have we learned? \n\n- The roots of our original polynomial $x^{3} - x^{2} -x - 2$ are $2$, $\\omega$\n  and $\\omega^{2}$.\n- Any polynomial expression on these roots satisfies a special property related\n  to rearranging the roots of the expression.\n- This property is that the operations of \"_not rearranging any root_\" and\n  \"_swapping $\\omega$ and $\\omega^{2}$_\" together completely determine when a\n  polynomial on the roots simplifies to a known rational number.\n- We got these two operations from the rearrangements obtained by plugging\n  the roots of the polynomial with known coefficients $x^{2} - 3x + 7$ (which\n  was smaller than expected) into the expressions for $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ in\n  terms of $t$.\n- From the monstrous polynomial with all rearrangements of roots in $t$, the\n  polynomial $x^{2} - 3x + 7$ is actually the factor with lowest degree that\n  has known rational coefficients and includes $t = 1 - \\omega$ as one of its\n  roots. It can't have degree 1 because that would mean $1-\\omega$ is a rational\n  number. Maybe this \"polynomial with lowest degree that has $t$ as a root\" is\n  a good rule of thumb in general?\n\n_But we already learned how to solve cubics... Why should I care about all of\nthis?_ There's a high chance you're asking yourself that question. I'll clarify\nshortly. We're on the verge of finding an _invariant_ of the original\npolynomial. This is how mathematicians refer to some special property that is\ninherent to an object. Something that doesn't change. \n\n_But what could change here?_ Well, in the above example we chose a specific\nlabeling of the roots (we said that $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = \\omega$ and\n$x_3 = \\omega^{2}$) and we also chose a certain special value $t = x_1 - x_2$.\nAnd we now know there might be more than one such value that works. Just\nimagine being able to create the same object, no matter which choice we wake\non the order of the roots or the value of $t$.\n\n_// Start of TV-drama cliffhanger_.\n\nWill we succeed?
