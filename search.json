    "text": "I know that one\nOur good ol’ friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations… Ok, yeah, they didn’t formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them. For us, this is a second degree equation:\n\\[\n  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\n\\]\nNow it’s your time to shine… You do remember that formula you were forced to memorize in high school, don’t you? Yes!\n\\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}  }{2a}\n\\]\nHuh…\nThis is supposed to be an entry to Summer of Math Exposition #4. If you check this link, you’ll find one part that goes like this:\n\nMost Frequently Requested Topics\nFoundation-Level Concepts (Ages 11-16):\n\nVariables and algebra - Students don’t understand that “x” represents an unknown value to find\n\n…\n\nWell, well, we just started and I’m already digging my own pit. I think I’ll just wait for someone else to address that in a whole post. If you happen to be one of those confused students and you end up here, well, good luck with that. You have all your time. Don’t think the post will be an easy read. But as for the prerequisites, I don’t expect from you anything more than the algebra and complex numbers you were taught in high school.\nWhile you probably knew the above formula with the coefficients \\(a, b, c\\) just like that, I’m going to be using the same letter with subscripts, where \\(a_i\\) is the coefficient of the term \\(x^{i}\\). Moreover, note that the coefficient \\(a_n\\) of the highest degree term (here \\(a_2\\)) is useless: the equation obtained from dividing everything by that coefficient will have the same roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are the roots the same?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(x_1\\) is a solution of \\(a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\\), then we have:\n\\[\n  a_2 x_1^{2} + a_1 x_1 + a_0 = 0\n\\]\nBut zero divided by any number will still be zero, so we have:\n\\[\n  \\frac{1}{a_2} \\cdot (a_2 x_1^{2} + a_1 x_1 + a_0) = \\frac{1}{a_2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nThis is the same as:\n\\[\n  x_1^{2} + \\frac{a_1}{a_2} x + \\frac{a_0}{a_2} = 0\n\\]\nThis last relation exactly means that \\(x_1\\) is also a solution of the new equation, which has no coefficient for the \\(x^{2}\\) term.\n\n\n\nSo the equation we’ll work with looks like this:\n\\[\n  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\n\\]\nWe haven’t talked about which values can the coefficients of the equation take. We could decide that they can be any natural number (\\(0, 1, 2\\dots\\)), any integer (\\(0, 1, -1, 2, -2\\dots\\)), any rational… From now on, we’ll assume they’re rational numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s a rational number?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a fancy term for fractions, the result of dividing one integer by another. They are things like \\(0, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{57}{3}, -2\\)… Of course, integers are also rationals because any integer \\(a\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{a}{1}\\).\n\n\n\nAnd why not choosing, say, just integers? Because we need some freedom with the operations we do with coefficients. When we talked about dividing everything by \\(a_2\\), we were already considering that the new coefficients had to be at least rational. Otherwise, depending on which division we perform, if we had integers initially, we could now end up with something that isn’t an integer anymore. Thus, if we choose rational coefficients we’re allowed to do basic operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with them and always be sure that the result will still be a rational number.\n\nIt’s dividing fractions… What’s dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?\n— Only yesterday (1991)\n\nNo, I’m not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an excuse to include a part of one of my favourite movies, where Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand the logic behind dividing fractions. Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it like that? This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception. I also feel like this, even while doing my research to write this post. Many suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it, meaning that you shouldn’t force yourself too far to get the logic behind some concepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While I do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I will try my best in this article to build some intuition.\nSo just for the last time, let’s rewrite the equation and the solution with the new letters…\n\\[\n  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \\text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$ are rationals}\n\\]\n\\[\n  x = \\frac{-a_1 \\pm \\sqrt{a_1^{2} -4 a_0} }{2}\n\\]"

    "section": "But how did you get there?",
    "text": "But how did you get there?\nShut up and memorize!\nJust joking. Let’s see what we can do…\nIn the previous section we talked about equations and solutions. We might sometimes still use that terminology, but we’re also going to talk about polynomials and roots. For our purposes, an equation can be expressed as \\(p(x) = 0\\), where \\(p(x)\\) is a polynomial. In the quadratic example, the polynomial would be \\(p(x) = x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0\\). A root of the polynomial is any value that gives an output of \\(0\\) when plugged as \\(x\\) into that polynomial. Therefore, a solution of the equation is a root of the polynomial.\nSuppose we give names \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) to our hypothetical roots. If something is a root, as we just said, it should evaluate the polynomial to \\(0\\). This must work for both roots, so when factored out, the polynomial should look like \\((x - x_1)(x - x_2)\\). Here, if we change \\(x\\) by either \\(x_1\\) or \\(x_2\\), the result will be \\(0\\) as expected. Can you express the coefficients \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\) in terms of the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: try expanding the product \\((x-x_1)(x-x_2)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s expand the product:\n\\[\n  (x - x_1) (x - x_2) = x^{2} + (- x_1 - x_2) x + x_1 x_2\n\\]\nBut considering the original polynomial looked like \\(x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0\\), that means we have the following equalities for our roots:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2   &= a_0\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe cool thing about these relations is that the result of adding or multiplying the roots is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals), even if the roots themselves might not be rational. In fact, knowing that, any weird expression made up of sums and products of roots, say \\(\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^{3}}{3x_1 x_2} -4(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 x_2)^{6}\\), will be rationally known. I’m using these words on purpose, because that’s how Galois himself referred to quantities that ultimately evaluate to a rational number, even if the operands themselves aren’t necessarily rationals (like our roots). Keep this cool observation in mind, you’ll see why in just a while.\nSo we have to figure out a formula for both roots. They’re just two now, yes, but you know this is going further, right? We will work with higher degree equations later. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could just find the value of one thing, and then get the value of all roots for free just from that? Of course, besides this weird value, we’re also allowed to use the original coefficients of the polynomial or any other known numbers.\nI’ll help you with that. There are probably a lot of values we could choose to find, but I’ll give you this one:\n\\[\n  t = x_1 - x_2\n\\]\nOf course you’re now supposed to check that this does encode everything about the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Can you write them in terms of \\(t\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: use also \\(-a_1 = x_1 + x_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember learning how to solve systems of equations in high school? Reduction method, is that you?\n\\[\n  \\left.\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\\\\n      -a_1 &= x_1 + x_2\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right\\}\n  \\Rightarrow\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - t}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nDo you see where this is going? Of course, we’ll now try to find the value of \\(t\\)! But why would this be easier?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: try to find the value of \\(t^{2}\\) first\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, instead of computing \\(t\\), let’s try with \\(t^{2}\\):\n\\[\n  t^{2} = (x_1 - x_2)^{2} = x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} - 2 x_1 x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^{2} - 4 x_1 x_2\n  \\overset{\\text{cool obs.}}{=} a_1^{2} - 4 a_0\n\\]\nYou do know what happened in the last step, right? The cool observation we made earlier. We put everything in terms of \\(x_1 + x_2\\) and \\(x_1 x_2\\), so we can then use the known rational coefficients, and we’re done. We know what \\(t^{2}\\) is, so we can now pick a square root and have \\(t = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4a_0}\\).\n\n\n\nNow that we know the value of \\(t\\), getting back the values of the original roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is routine substitution in the equalities we stated earlier.\nBut before claiming our trophy in the form of a final result, let’s expand our perspective a bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we’re sure that \\(t\\) is a root, and we know how to solve this new equation. That way we would get the value of \\(t\\), just like above, hoping that it would be easier than trying to solve the original equation.\nSo… How does such an equation look like? The one I’ll show you won’t be too surprising, and you’ll even think I’m just making fun of you, but keep in mind I’m trying to prepare a recipe for future sections. Alright, the equation:\n\\[\n  (x - t)(x + t) = 0\n\\]\nOf course this equation makes sense. We already made a useful observation before. If \\(t\\) has to be a root, there must be a factor like \\((x - t)\\) out there. The reason we also included \\((x + t)\\) is that now this product will give a neat result, as you might expect from before. Yes, we just happen to know that because we already calculated \\(t^{2}\\) before, and this seems to be some circular reasoning, but bear with me, this will be a useful reinterpretation later…\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  (x - t)(x + t) = 0 \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x^{2} - t^{2} = 0 \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x^{2} = t^{2} \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  x = \\sqrt{t^{2}} = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0} = t\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nAt this point you might be wondering why I never bother to write the typical sign \\(\\pm\\) to represent that we could take either the positive or the negative value, in this case, when taking the square root. At least for our quadratic example, this is irrelevant! Why? Well, you just look back at the relations:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - t}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\nIf we take the positive value, that is, \\(t = \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}\\), then we get the solutions:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 + \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 - \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\nIf we instead take the negative value, i.e., \\(t = -\\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}\\), then our solutions will be:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      x_1 &= \\frac{-a_1 - \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\\\\n      x_2 &= \\frac{-a_1 + \\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\nThey’re the same but swapped! So who cares? We just wanted to find the roots in the first place, we didn’t even define what should be called \\(x_1\\) and what \\(x_2\\), there’s just no difference. This also somehow addresses another question you might have had. We want to find the value of the root \\(t\\) from the new equation. But how do we even know which one of the roots is \\(t\\)? Well, as we just said, it turns out any of them works… The more general answer to this question isn’t that easy, but will play a crucial role in our understanding of these equations, and we’ll get back to it later. No spoilers."

Just to recap, this is what we have to start with:\n\\[\n  x^{3} + a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \\text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$ are rationals}\n\\]\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= -a_2 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 &= a_1 \\\\\n  x_1 x_2 x_3 &= -a_0\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\nRemember what we did in the Second degree section? We were discussing the possibility of finding a special value \\(t\\) which could encode all the information about our roots, in the sense that we could find their values just from \\(t\\) itself and other known values. For the quadratic we used \\(t = x_1 - x_2\\). Can we find such a value for the cubic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Can you use the solutions of the equation \\(x^{3} = 1\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes we can! Did you think about complex roots of unity? If you like following the pattern, for the quadratic we have \\(t = \\alpha_1 x_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2\\) where \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\) are the solutions of the equation \\(x^{2} = 1\\). These are of course \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\).\nWhat are the solutions of \\(x^{3} = 1\\)? They’re \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a complex root of \\(x^{2} + x + 1 = 0\\). Then, again just following the pattern, we could think of the following special value:\n\\[\n  t = x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3\n\\]\nThis is just a hunch! In order to use this, we should actually show that all \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\) can be expressed in terms of this \\(t\\) and other known values.\n\n\n\nNow that we got the value, it’s time to show that the roots can be expressed in terms of this \\(t\\)… Or that’s what I thought while writing this. Too optimistic… I’m not saying it’s not possible, but it can be quite difficult to get those formulas. Instead of trying to narrow down to a single value \\(t\\), let’s try for a moment to use two values, the other being very similar to \\(t\\). I’ll help you with this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck these relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  t &= x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 \\\\\n  t' &= x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 + \\omega x_3 \\\\\n  -a_2 &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nCan you now find the roots by using \\(t\\), \\(t'\\), \\(\\omega\\) and the coefficients?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Can you use the fact that \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can try to sum all three equations multiplied by specific coefficients so that our root remains there and the other two are cancelled out à la reduction method, because of the given relation of \\(\\omega\\).\nDoing that, we get these formulas for the roots:\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 &= \\frac{t + t' - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_2 &= \\frac{\\omega^{2} t + \\omega t' - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_3 &= \\frac{\\omega t + \\omega^{2} t' - a_2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nOK, so we can get the roots by using both \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\). Yes, I know what you’re thinking. We now have to find two values instead of one, but trust me, this is justified, since these values seem so similar that I hope we’ll be able to find both of them at the same time.\nYou already know how this goes, now we have to build a polynomial for which \\(t\\) is a root, and hopefully, just hopefully, \\(t'\\) will also be one of its roots. Let’s recall, or rather expand, the way we built the polynomial for the quadratic case. I told you it would be helpful later, and the time has come.\nRemember that we had \\(t = x_1 - x_2\\). Our special polynomial for the quadratic was this:\n\\[\n  (x - t)(x + t) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x + (x_1 - x_2)) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x - (x_2 - x_1))\n  = x^{2} - ((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1)) x + (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)\n\\]\nYou already know what the actual polynomial is, but I left it in this last form to notice something: the coefficients are symmetric polynomials on the roots! If you try swapping \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in both expressions \\(((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1))\\) and \\((x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)\\), you get the same result. In the previous section, we just saw that all symmetric polynomials on the roots are actually known values. They’re made from the coefficients of the original equation, which were rational, so we got a new equation with rational coefficients.\nOf course, there is one concern. Perhaps this new equation is just as hard to solve as the original one, and then we did something completely useless. While that’s a possibility, we were hoping that our choice of \\(t\\) would make the new equation sufficiently easy to solve. In the case of the quadratic, you know that this was true because we were able to lose the term of \\(x\\), and get a simpler quadratic \\(x^{2} - t^{2} = 0\\), which only requires to take a square root to solve.\nWe saw the coefficients we got in the end are symmetric polynomials, but we could have deduced that from the start, from the way we defined the polynomial as a product. Yes, in the quadratic example it was easier to see why we would benefit from choosing both \\(t\\) and \\(-t\\) (sum times difference is the difference of squares). Another way to look at this is that \\(-t\\) is the result of swapping the roots in \\(t\\):\n\\[\n  (x - (\\text{t with no swaps}))(x - (\\text{t with roots swapped}))\n\\]\nThis form is telling us that this is a symmetric polynomial on the roots, and therefore, that its final coefficients will be known rational values. Can you see why? I’ll let you figure that out, because now it’s your turn again… Can you use this idea to find a suitable new polynomial for the cubic, for which \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) are two of its roots? Just to remember, these are their expressions:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 \\\\\n      t' &= x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 + \\omega x_3\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n  \\quad\n  \\text{The value $\\omega$ is such that $1+\\omega+\\omega^{2} = 0$}\n\\]\nCome on, try to find the polynomial!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Why is the quadratic example a symmetric polynomial on its roots?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe defined it as the product of two terms. Note that the order of the product doesn’t matter. What happens to the expression if we swap the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)? Then we get:\n\\[\n  (x - (\\text{t with roots swapped}))(x - (\\text{t with no swaps}))\n\\]\nAnd this is certainly the same polynomial. For the quadratic, all the possible rearrangements are only swapping both roots or leaving them the same way. Since all these rearrangements give the same polynomial, we can say the polynomial is symmetric in the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Do you see how this helps for the cubic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You’ll get a wild expression for the cubic, but try to simplify as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous hint talked about all rearrangements of the roots. This should already be a really good hint. Yes, we’re doing exactly that. Let’s start from \\(t\\) and find all possible expressions that come from rearrangements of \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) in \\(t\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3 &= t \\\\\n  x_1 + \\omega x_3 + \\omega^{2} x_2 &= t' \\\\\n  x_3 + \\omega x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_2 &= \\omega t \\\\\n  x_2 + \\omega x_1 + \\omega^{2} x_3 &= \\omega t' \\\\\n  x_2 + \\omega x_3 + \\omega^{2} x_1 &= \\omega^{2} t \\\\\n  x_3 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_1 &= \\omega^{2} t'\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\nThere are quite some things going on there, so you’d better pause and check those relations hold. Note that we also included \\(t'\\) in there! We now see that \\(t'\\) was just one of the expressions obtained from the rearrangements of the roots in \\(t\\). Of course, now we’ll build a polynomial that has all of these as roots, so in particular it will have both \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) as roots, just like we wanted! The reason I wrote the equalities above is so that we now don’t have to write the absolute beast that this polynomial would be as a product. We will instead just write the right side of the equalities:\n\\[\n  (x - t)(x - t')(x - \\omega t)(x - \\omega t')(x - \\omega^{2} t)(x - \\omega^{2} t')\n\\]\nOh, yeah, we’re going to have fun trying to simplify this… But by now we should know that, no matter how complicated it looks, in the end, this should be a polynomial with rational coefficients. It’s a symmetric polynomial on the roots, we made it like that by multiplying all rearrangements of roots.\nWhat happens if we try to multiply only those terms having \\(t\\)? I’ll let you check that, but the product simplifies nicely because of the relations \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0\\) and \\(\\omega^{3} = 1\\):\n\\[\n  (x - t)(x - \\omega t)(x - \\omega^{2} t) = x^{3} - t^{3}\n\\]\nWe can of course do the same with the terms involving \\(t'\\):\n\\[\n  (x - t')(x - \\omega t')(x - \\omega^{2} t') = x^{3} - t'^{3}\n\\]\nSo because of the useful relations that we got from the roots of unity, our product simplified into this much cleaner expression:\n\\[\n  (x^{3} - t^{3})(x^{3} - t'^{3})\n\\]\n\n\n\nYes, we still have some work to do to simplify that…"

Of course, we can’t hide everything inside these boxes and the text must keep flowing. I’ll now have to show how the polynomial we were looking for in the previous section looks like, but I’m showing a simplified expression. The moral of the story is that the spoiler isn’t the polynomial itself, because it’s simplified. The real spoiler is the series of steps you needed to get there! Remember we’re trying to build intuition.\nAnd in fact, we already got a lot of intuition from the previous section! This section is only meant to show you that we can actually end and get the solutions of the cubic, although it’s more of a rutinary calculation from here on. You and me are both lazy human beings that don’t bother doing those mundane calculations, do we? Let’s see what we can do…\nWe left at this point:\n\\[\n  (x^{3} - t^{3})(x^{3} - t'^{3})\n\\]\nWe can expand that product and get this:\n\\[\n  x^{6} - (t^{3} + t'^{3}) x^{3} + t^{3} t'^{3}\n\\]\nSee, the values \\(t^{3}\\) and \\(t'^{3}\\) don’t have to be rationals themselves, but since this came from a symmetric polynomial on the roots, the coefficients must be rationals!

I’ll tell you what they really are, but we’ll give them short names \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) for a while after that:\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  u &= t^{3} + t'^{3} = - 27 a_{0} + 9 a_{1} a_{2} - 2 a_{2}^{3} \\\\\n  v &= t^{3} t'^{3} = (- 3 a_{1} + a_{2}^{2})^{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you still want to know how I got them…\n\n\n\n\n\nLet the computer do the boring stuff for you! We can use the sympy package available in Python. If you’re interested but never used Python, it’s fine, most of it reads more or less like math, so you can probably still read through the steps below.\nWe first define all the symbols we need in our expressions:\n\nimport sympy\n\nx1, x2, x3, a0, a1, a2, w = sympy.symbols(\"x1 x2 x3 a0 a1 a2 w\")\nt = x1 + w * x2 + w**2 * x3\nt_prime = x1 + w**2 * x2 + w * x3\n\nHere I tried to guess that \\(t \\cdot t'\\) is already a symmetric polynomial. If that’s true, then we only need to raise that to the third power.\n\nfrom sympy.polys.polyfuncs import symmetrize\n\nexpr, _ = symmetrize(t * t_prime, [x1, x2, x3])\n\nexpr = expr.subs(\n    {\n        x1 + x2 + x3: -a2,\n        x1 * x2 + x2 * x3 + x3 * x1: a1,\n        x1 * x2 * x3: -a0,\n    }\n)\n\nexpr\n\n\\(\\displaystyle a_{1} \\left(w^{2} + w - 2\\right) + a_{2}^{2}\\)\n\n\nLooks like poor sympy needs some help with \\(\\omega\\)… Of course! It doesn’t even know what \\(\\omega\\) is yet.\n\nexpr.subs(1 + w + w**2, 0)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - 3 a_{1} + a_{2}^{2}\\)\n\n\nAnd \\(t \\cdot t'\\) was indeed a symmetric polynomial! Then we also got the desired value:\n\\[\n  t^3 t'^3 = (-3 a_1 + a_2^2)^3\n\\]\nLet’s do the same for \\(t^{3} + t'^{3}\\):\n\nexpr, _ = symmetrize(t**3 + t_prime**3, [x1, x2, x3])\n\nexpr = expr.subs(\n    {\n        x1 + x2 + x3: -a2,\n        x1 * x2 + x2 * x3 + x3 * x1: a1,\n        x1 * x2 * x3: -a0,\n    }\n)\n\nexpr\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - a_{0} \\left(12 w^{3} - 9 w^{2} - 9 w + 6\\right) - a_{1} a_{2} \\left(3 w^{2} + 3 w - 6\\right) - 2 a_{2}^{3}\\)\n\n\nWe can first get rid of the \\(\\omega^{3}\\) part:\n\nexpr = expr.subs(w**3, 1)\nexpr\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - a_{0} \\left(- 9 w^{2} - 9 w + 18\\right) - a_{1} a_{2} \\left(3 w^{2} + 3 w - 6\\right) - 2 a_{2}^{3}\\)\n\n\n\nexpr.subs(1 + w + w**2, 0)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - a_{0} \\left(- 9 w^{2} - 9 w + 18\\right) - a_{1} a_{2} \\left(3 w^{2} + 3 w - 6\\right) - 2 a_{2}^{3}\\)\n\n\nYou naughty sympy, why won’t you listen to me? Well, let’s try simplifying first…\n\nexpr.simplify().subs(1 + w + w**2, 0)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - 27 a_{0} + 9 a_{1} a_{2} - 2 a_{2}^{3}\\)\n\n\nYes! We got a really neat expression:\n\\[\n  t^{3} + t'^{3} = - 27 a_{0} + 9 a_{1} a_{2} - 2 a_{2}^{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the actual values of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) later, just to not write too long equations. It turns out we end up with a surprisingly cool equation:\n\\[\n  x^{6} - u x^{3} + v = 0\n\\]\nAnother way to look at it is this:\n\\[\n  (x^{3})^{2} - u (x^{3}) + v = 0\n\\]\nCan you see it? This is really just a quadratic equation!\n\\[\n  x^{3} = \\frac{u \\pm \\sqrt{u^{2} - 4v}}{2}\n\\]\nWe can obviously just take a cube root now and obtain a solution:\n\\[\n  x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{u \\pm \\sqrt{u^{2} - 4v}}{2}}\n\\]\nNo, this isn’t one solution, these are a lot of solutions! Yes, that’s right. We already had this kind of discussion before, right? In this case, we have two possible values for the inner square root, and three possible values for the outer cube root. The six possible solutions! Which ones are \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\)? Unfortunately, in this case, we can’t just choose any combination.\nBy now I think it’s time we get rid of \\(t'\\). How come? Well, we already derived a useful relation:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t \\cdot t' = - 3 a_{1} + a_{2}^{2} \\\\\n  \\Downarrow \\\\\n  t' = \\frac{- 3 a_{1} + a_{2}^{2} }{t}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nLet’s go back to our original equations for the roots. We originally wanted to get back the roots by just using one quantity \\(t\\) and other known values. We finally made it!\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  x_1 &= \\frac{t + \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_2 &= \\frac{\\omega^{2} t + \\omega \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3} \\\\\n  x_3 &= \\frac{\\omega t + \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\quad\n\\text{where } k = -3 a_1 + a_2^{2}\n\\]\nDid the question change in any way? How do we know which root of the new polynomial is the \\(t\\) we want? Of course, we could always try all six possible values in these equations for \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\), and double check if they really are solutions of the original cubic equation.\nWill you do that for me? Well…\nBefore we die in the attempt, let’s try to give some short expressions for all six roots. We will fix one of them and get the others in terms of that one. We’ll call this one \\(t\\), but this is just a name for a fixed root, it could be any of them. Suppose then that \\(t\\) is this:\n\\[\n  t = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{u + \\sqrt{u^{2} - 4v}}{2}}\n\\]\nWhen taking cube roots, one way of writing all three of them is to fix one and multiply by roots of unity to get the others (because of course you get the same if you again raise to the third power). That means another two roots are \\(\\omega t\\) and \\(\\omega^{2} t\\).\nWhat about the other three? We should take the negative sign for the square root inside. If we call that one \\(t'\\), we then have the relation we defined earlier:\n\\[\n  t \\cdot t' = k \\Rightarrow t' = \\frac{k}{t} \\quad \\text{where } k = -3 a_1 + a_2^{2}\n\\]\nSo another root is \\(\\frac{k}{t}\\). Since there’s also a cube root there, we can pick another two roots to be \\(\\omega \\frac{k}{t}\\) and \\(\\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t}\\). So after fixing one root \\(t\\), all six of them can be expressed like this:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  t, \\omega t, \\omega ^{2} t, \\frac{k}{t}, \\omega \\frac{k}{t}, \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t}\n  \\right\\}\n\\]\nRemember this \\(t\\) was just some fixed root. If we use this one, in the equations above for the roots, we would get \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) in that order. That’s basically just the definition. How about trying to input \\(\\omega t\\) where \\(t\\) appears in the equations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Try to relate with the original expressions in \\(t\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{(\\omega t) + \\frac{k}{(\\omega t)} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{\\omega t + \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3} &= x_3 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\omega^{2} (\\omega t) + \\omega \\frac{k}{(\\omega t)} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{t + \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3} &= x_1 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\omega (\\omega t) + \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{(\\omega t)} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{\\omega^{2} t + \\omega \\frac{k}{t} - a_2}{3} &= x_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\nIn the first one we used the equality \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\omega^{2}\\).\n\n\n\nPerhaps unexpectedly, we got the same set of solutions, but in a different arrangement! Let’s try with another one, for example, \\(\\frac{k}{t}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: same idea as before\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{(\\frac{k}{t}) + \\frac{k}{(\\frac{k}{t})} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{k}{t} + t - a_2}{3} &= x_1 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\omega^{2} (\\frac{k}{t}) + \\omega \\frac{k}{\\frac{k}{t}} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{\\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t} + \\omega t - a_2}{3} &= x_3 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\omega (\\frac{k}{t}) + \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{(\\frac{k}{t})} - a_2}{3} = \\frac{\\omega \\frac{k}{t} + \\omega^{2} t - a_2}{3} &= x_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe got another rearrangement of the roots! What kind of witchery is this? Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to become tired of writing these equations… I claim that each one of the roots of the new polynomial gives a different rearrangement of the roots \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) when introduced in the formulae of the roots. Thus, any root of the new polynomial will give us valid solutions for the original equation, no matter which one we take. Of course, you don’t need to trust me, you can check it yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the rearrangements\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t \\mapsto (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\\\\n      \\omega t \\mapsto (x_3, x_1, x_2) \\\\\n      \\omega^{2} t \\mapsto (x_2, x_3, x_1) \\\\\n      \\frac{k}{t} \\mapsto (x_1, x_3, x_2) \\\\\n      \\omega \\frac{k}{t} \\mapsto (x_2, x_1, x_3) \\\\\n      \\omega^{2} \\frac{k}{t} \\mapsto (x_3, x_2, x_1) \\\\\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nYes, we have the cool result that any root of the new polynomial is valid for getting the original solutions of the cubic. But what do you think about these neat rearrangements? Are they only useful for the above conclusion, or can we do more with them? Was this a coincidence, or a more general result? Save some popcorn for later. I warned you."

    "title": "But can I really solve this equation?",
    "section": "Cubic, u still there?",
    "text": "Cubic, u still there?\nIn the third degree section we found ourselves solving the general cubic equation thanks to this special value \\(t = x_1 + \\omega x_2 + \\omega^{2} x_3\\). I think we managed to justify why this special one is quite helpful for solving the cubic. I mean this in the sense that, the new equation we have to solve is simple enough, so that finding one of its roots is easier than finding a root of the original equation, even if the new one has sixth degree.\nAnyway, a natural question would be: Are there other special values that allow us to solve the original equation in the same way? And we’re now only interested in the theoretical question. We don’t mind if the new equation is hard to solve or not. We really only want to know if there are other special values which encode all information about the roots.\nLet’s try ourselves! I’m a bit tired of writing monstrous equations though. We’ll try with a specific example, of which we could even know the roots in advance. Remember this is just a sort of thought experiment. OK, so our cubic equation will be this:\n\\[\n  x^{3} - x^{2} - x - 2 = 0\n\\]\nWe can quickly check if there is an integer solution by only trying the values \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\) for \\(x\\). Maybe you even recall doing this in high school!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you see why?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can rewrite the equation like this:\n\\[\n  x \\cdot (x^{2} - x - 1) = 2\n\\]\nIf \\(x\\) was an integer, we would have \\(x \\cdot \\text{other integer} = 2\\), so \\(x\\) must be a divisor of \\(2\\). The only possible values would then be \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\n\n\nIt turns out that \\(x = 2\\) is a valid solution (you can verify it). That means the cubic polynomial will have a factor \\((x-2)\\). Were you told how to perform polynomial long division? If so, go ahead, factor this cubic! If not, don’t worry, we have some workarounds. We can try to write the factorization like this:\n\\[\n  x^{3} - x^{2} -x - 2 = (x-2)(x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\)? Hint: expand the product and compare coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n  x^{3} + (a_1 - 2) x^{2} + (a_0 - 2 a_1) x - 2 a_0\n\\]\nFollowing the coefficients of the original polynomial, we must have \\(-2 a_0 = -2\\), so \\(a_0 = 1\\). Likewise, \\(a_1 - 2 = -1\\), so \\(a_1 = 1\\). These also give the expected result for \\(a_0 - 2 a_1 = -1\\), so we got the coefficients. The factorization is then:\n\\[\n  x^{3} - x^{2} - x - 2 = (x-2)(x^{2} + x + 1) = (x-2)(x-\\omega)(x-\\omega^{2})\n\\]\nWe also know the last equality! The polynomial \\(x^{2} + x + 1\\) is already familiar to us, and we defined its solutions as \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}\\).\n\n\n\nSo we now know the three solutions of this equation. We’re cheating! Who cares? Let’s try a different special value! If you recall, we used \\(t = x_1 - x_2\\) for the quadratic equation. Well, let’s just try it with the cubic as well, and see what happens.\nSuppose we like defining \\(x_1 = 2\\), \\(x_2 = \\omega\\), \\(x_3 = \\omega^{2}\\). Then we can have these relations:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\\\\n      \\frac{7}{t} &= x_1 - x_3 \\\\\n      1 &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did those come from?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first one is just the current definition for \\(t\\). The last one comes from the coefficient relation \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -a_2\\) we already saw in a previous section. The second one comes from a product:\n\\[\n  (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3) = (2 - \\omega)(2 - \\omega^{2}) = 4 -2\\omega -2\\omega^{2} + \\omega^{3} = 6 - 2 (1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2}) + 1 = 7\n\\]\nThen we have\n\\[\n  (x_1 - x_3) = \\frac{7}{x_1 - x_2} = \\frac{7}{t}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing the above relations, can you obtain all roots in terms of \\(t\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Use reduction method!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in other examples, this is a matter of summing all equations, each one multiplied by a certain number to cancel out the roots we don’t want. After you find the correct numbers you get:\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    x_1 &= \\frac{t + \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3} \\\\\n    x_2 &= \\frac{-2t + \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3} \\\\\n    x_3 &= \\frac{t - 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{t} + 1}{3}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nYes! It turns out we can use a different special value, and still be able to encode the information of all roots. Now that we have the roots in terms of \\(t\\), we only need the values of \\(t\\). You know what to do now, don’t you? The new equation from which we get the values of \\(t\\) is that one with products of all possible rearrangements of \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) in \\(t\\). Since we’re cheating and we already know the roots of the original polynomial, we can save ourselves from building that new polynomial monstrosity and directly write down all its six roots. In case you’re a bit lost, I’ll tell you the first one, which comes from no rearrangement: \\(t = x_1 - x_2 = 2 - \\omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich are the rearrangements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    t &= x_1 - x_2 = 2 - \\omega \\\\\n    \\frac{7}{t} &= x_1 - x_3 = 2 - \\omega^{2} \\\\\n    -t &= x_2 - x_1 = \\omega - 2 \\\\\n    -\\frac{7}{t} &= x_3 - x_1 = \\omega^{2} - 2 \\\\\n    -t + \\frac{7}{t} &= x_2 - x_3 = \\omega - \\omega^{2} \\\\\n    t - \\frac{7}{t} &= x_3 - x_2 = \\omega^{2} - \\omega\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\nThe right side of each equation is the actual rearrangement of the roots. I only wrote the left side to show you they can be written in terms of \\(t\\), and in case these alternative expressions are useful to you to more easily plug them into the root relations to calculate \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\).\n\n\n\nNow for the final step! Let’s try to get those roots back from the values of \\(t\\). I said values in plural on purpose. In the general cubic, we somehow got the striking result that all values of \\(t\\) are valid because they just give back a different arrangement of \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\). Here we’re interested in seeing if this still holds for a different special value \\(t\\). Alright, I’ll also include this one in a spoiler just in case you’re in the mood for some calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the roots for each possible value of \\(t\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    t = 2 - \\omega &\\mapsto (2, \\omega, \\omega^{2}) \\\\\n    \\frac{7}{t} = 2 - \\omega^{2} &\\mapsto (2, \\omega^{2}, \\omega) \\\\\n    -t = \\omega - 2 &\\mapsto \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2}{3} - \\omega, \\frac{5}{3} + \\omega \\right) \\\\\n    -\\frac{7}{t} = \\omega^{2} - 2 &\\mapsto \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2}{3} - \\omega^{2}, \\frac{5}{3} + \\omega^{2} \\right) \\\\\n    -t + \\frac{7}{t} = \\omega - \\omega^{2} &\\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{13}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{17}{9}(\\omega - \\omega^{2})\\right) \\\\\n    t - \\frac{7}{t} = \\omega^{2} - \\omega &\\mapsto \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{13}{9} (\\omega - \\omega^{2}), \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{17}{9}(\\omega - \\omega^{2})\\right)\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right.\n\\]\n\n\n\nHuh… What is this absolute rubbish? We expected some neat rearrangements of the roots \\(2\\), \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega^{2}\\), and, well, we got that for the first two possible values of \\(t\\), but we got some ugly results for the others… Unfortunately, we’ll have to conclude from this that not all solutions of the new equation can be used to get the solutions of the original one.\nBut we can certainly use some of them. You see, the ones corresponding to \\(2 - \\omega = t\\) and \\(2 - \\omega^{2} = \\frac{7}{t}\\) did give the intended solutions. Now the next question should be: Is there some rule to know exactly which solutions of the new equation do retrieve the solutions for the original one?\nIn this case, let’s consider a smaller part of the new equation. Let’s compute the product of only those two factors including the roots that worked:\n\\[\n  (x - (2 - \\omega))(x - (2 - \\omega^{2})) = x^{2} -(2 - \\omega + 2 - \\omega^{2})x + (2-\\omega)(2-\\omega^{2})\n\\]\nIn fact, this is already a polynomial with known coefficients! The coefficient for \\(x\\) simplifies thanks to \\(1+\\omega+\\omega^{2} = 0\\), and we already computed the product \\((2-\\omega)(2-\\omega^{2})\\) before. The polynomial is then:\n\\[\n  x^{2} -3x + 7\n\\]\nThe whole point of computing a huge product of all rearrangements was that we were sure the resulting polynomial would have known coefficients. We didn’t expect that, at least in this case, a smaller polynomial containing \\(t\\) would already have known coefficients. We could already find \\(t\\) from this even easier polynomial, since it’s just quadratic. And thanks to our half-failure from before, we also know that the other four roots were completely useless.\nFollowing on that idea, remember when we factored the original polynomial because one of the roots was an integer. The other part would then be \\(x^{2} + x + 1\\), and we know from quadratics that \\(x_2 + x_3 = -1\\) and \\(x_2 \\cdot x_3 = 1\\). In the First symmetry section we learned that:\nAny symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number.\nIn this example, because of the root \\(x_1\\) already being rational, we can use the same reasoning for only the other two roots, so we can be even more specific:\nAny symmetric polynomial on the roots \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) is a known number.\nThis shows that, at least sometimes, if we confirm a polynomial on the roots is unchanged by some of the rearrangements, not necessarily all of them, we can already be sure that its result is a known number.\nWhat about the other way around? If we know a polynomial on the roots is a known number, will it always be unchanged by those specific rearrangements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our specific example, the answer is yes! Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nAny polynomial on the roots \\(x_2 = \\omega\\) and \\(x_3 = \\omega^{2}\\) can actually be written as \\(a + b \\omega\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rationals. How? We can just rewrite \\(\\omega^{2}\\) as \\(-1 -\\omega\\) because of the relation \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^{2} = 0\\), and then group all terms based on whether they multiply an \\(\\omega\\) or not.\nIf the polynomial is written like that, then being a known rational value means that \\(b\\) must be an expression that simplifies to zero. This again means that swapping \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}\\) in this expression doesn’t change the result, since that would only change \\(a + b \\omega\\) to \\(a + b \\omega^{2}\\), but we still have \\(b\\) simplifying to zero anyway.\n\n\n\nSo what have we learned?\n\nThe roots of our original polynomial \\(x^{3} - x^{2} -x - 2\\) are \\(2\\), \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}\\).\nAny polynomial expression on these roots satisfies a special property related to rearranging the roots of the expression.\nThis property is that the operations of “not rearranging any root” and “swapping \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}\\)” together completely determine when a polynomial on the roots simplifies to a known rational number.\nWe got these two operations from the rearrangements obtained by plugging the roots of the polynomial with known coefficients \\(x^{2} - 3x + 7\\) (which was smaller than expected) into the expressions for \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) in terms of \\(t\\).\nFrom the monstrous polynomial with all rearrangements of roots in \\(t\\), the polynomial \\(x^{2} - 3x + 7\\) is actually the factor with lowest degree that has known rational coefficients and includes \\(t = 1 - \\omega\\) as one of its roots. It can’t have degree 1 because that would mean \\(1-\\omega\\) is a rational number. Maybe this “polynomial with lowest degree that has \\(t\\) as a root” is a good rule of thumb in general?\n\nBut we already learned how to solve cubics… Why should I care about all of this? There’s a high chance you’re asking yourself that question. I’ll clarify shortly. We’re on the verge of finding an invariant of the original polynomial. This is how mathematicians refer to some special property that is inherent to an object. Something that doesn’t change.\nBut what could change here? Well, in the above example we chose a specific labeling of the roots (we said that \\(x_1 = 2\\), \\(x_2 = \\omega\\) and \\(x_3 = \\omega^{2}\\)) and we also chose a certain special value \\(t = x_1 - x_2\\). And we now know there might be more than one such value that works. Just imagine being able to create the same object, no matter which choice we wake on the order of the roots or the value of \\(t\\).\n// Start of TV-drama cliffhanger.\nWill we succeed?

    "text": "Excuse me, can I borrow your sound?\nOkay, our previous game wasn’t fair. Instead, I could have told you that the number 4 is written as 亖, and you would, of course, believe me. How is this not better than 四? What is 四 even representing?\nYou see, Chinese people like their characters stylized. The character 亖 was once the representation of the number 4 in ancient times, but they must have felt that four horizontal strokes were too much—not exactly in line with their idea of beautiful characters. They could have chosen other visual ways to represent numbers (good ol’ tally marks?), but instead, they took another ingenious path.\nEnter the world of sound loan.\nBecause spoken language is older than written language, people already had a sound for the number 4 (sì). Incidentally, the sound for ‘to exhale’ was also sì—believe it or not, it was originally represented by 四 (trust me, this is a depiction of a nose). Can you connect the dots? There was a character, 四, that already had a meaning (to exhale), but people also started using it for another meaning (the number 4) just because the sounds matched. Now, for the number 4, the character only tells us how to say it, there’s no direct meaning involved! As is often the case with these examples, over time, the original meaning of ‘to exhale’ gradually fell out of use. It was later represented by 呬, with a mouth (口) component added to reinforce the meaning and distinguish it from 四. Even so, the character 呬 eventually became obsolete too, with speakers now opting instead for compound words (terms made of at least two characters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Evolution of number 4 (leftmost) to borrowed to exhale, nose depiction (the rest)\n\n\n\nNo matter if the explanation for the number 4 left you satisfied or disappointed, the truth is that the characters for the rest of the numbers follow the same concept of sound loan. We could now discuss the next number, the number 5, which is represented by the character 五 (wǔ). A sharp reader might try to explain that this character is made up of five strokes, so maybe there were five individual lines at some point in the past. In fact, a more experienced Chinese learner would know that the character is actually written with four strokes (one with a bend), not five, and even if we look at early texts, there are only four well defined strokes, following a crisscross pattern, which was also the original meaning. While there are some theories that try to explain this choice, the most logical one is still—you guessed it—just a sound loan. The sound for the number 5 happened to match, so the character was borrowed just for its sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Evolution of the character 五 now used to represent the number 5\n\n\n\nThis pattern of borrowing a character only for its sound and using it to represent a meaning completely unrelated to the original character’s meaning is quite common in general—it’s not limited to numbers. For instance, another one of the first characters Chinese learners see is 我 (wǒ), which is used as the first person singular pronoun (‘I’ in English). This character is a depiction of a trident-like weapon. You already know where this is going, don’t you? Yes, just a sound loan.\nI am not a linguist myself, but I am at a point where I find knowing the real explanations (i.e., the most widely accepted by scholars) much more satisfying than coming up with a mnemonic story to remember the character and its meaning, even if the latter seems easier. In the end, we still have to learn by repetition. Anyway, I have nothing against mnemonics themselves (Heisig enjoyers, u there?), as long as we acknowledge that the vast majority are made up. However, there is usually only a really thin line between these stories and folk etymology (people thinking these stories are the real origins of the meanings). Maybe some readers have heard the popular explanation for 我—that it depicts a hand (手) holding a weapon (戈) to protect oneself (我). While the story sounds reasonable, scholars believe it to be a reinterpretation of the character into more commonly understood concepts, which is why it falls into folk etymology. In contrast, our sound loan explanation is simple but less sticky, which is why many people don’t find it useful.\nMany students who start learning Chinese feel attracted by the characters so much so that they often fall for The ideographic myth4. Thus, methods like Heisig’s Remembering the Hanzi disregard character pronunciation, as if it were acceptable for students to turn a deaf ear to the characters’ voices. I myself used Remembering the Kanji—the equivalent for Japanese characters—when I was learning Japanese, and memorized hundreds of them without knowing how to pronounce them. There is actually a part 2 of Remembering the Kanji which focuses on mnemonic stories for how characters are read, although as far as I know this doesn’t exist in Remembering the Hanzi, making it rather detrimental.\nI started with a popular statistic about 80% of Chinese characters being able to speak. This was to catch the reader’s attention, because in reality this percentage doesn’t include the sound loan characters introduced in this section. While not many people know about the widespread use of sound loan in common characters, others do know about another special type—the one actually being referred to when talking about the 80%—and potentially the most important when trying to decipher the characters’ voices."

    "section": "But my life isn’t totally meaningless",
    "text": "But my life isn’t totally meaningless\nOf course, let’s not forget that at some point in ancient times, before some were borrowed for their sound, all characters did have an original meaning. Recall, for example, the character 马 introduced in the dialogue, which is a depiction of a horse, as a simplified version of 馬. Do you still not see the horse here? Oh well…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Evolution of the 馬 character from left to right\n\n\n\nNow the meaning argument goes like this: Chinese characters, when part of larger characters, still contribute their meaning as part of a compound explanation. If we believe this, then naturally, we must find a reasonable story to connect the pieces in the character 玛—we have to find a way to connect the seemingly unrelated meanings of its components gemstone and horse. While certain characters composed only of meaning components—known as associative compounds—are widely accepted, we shouldn’t force this idea onto the vast majority of compound characters, despite many attempts to do so.\nEnter the world of phono-semantic compounds.\nOur example 玛 (agate5) has a much simpler explanation—though for some, a less satisfying one. The character 马 is pronounced mǎ, and, well, the character 玛 is pronounced—yeah, you guessed it—also mǎ. The character has a meaning component, 𤣩, which provides a small hint—indicating that it’s a kind of gemstone—and a sound component, which suggests its pronunciation but doesn’t necessarily contribute to its meaning. This is how phono-semantic characters work. Believe it or not, you now more or less understand how 80% of Chinese characters work.\nNow that we know 马 can be used as a sound component, a Chinese learner might recall two other characters that are taught right at the start.\n\nThe character 吗 (ma). This is used as a sentence-final particle6 to denote yes-no questions. Particles are often another example of phono-semantic characters. They typically include the mouth 口 (i.e. speech) as the meaning component, alone with the sound component. In the case of 吗, our lovely horse provides the sound. Just note that the tone7 is not the same, but as I mentioned earlier, the sound component serves as a hint and doesn’t need to be exactly spot on.\nThe character 妈 (mā), which means mother, usually also doubled as 妈妈. From the previous dialogue, you now know that 女 means woman. What do women have to do with horses? Oh, come on, Chinese characters are not a joke… Fortunately, by this point, you can already understand how this works: a mother is a woman, and 马 provides the sound—it’s as simple as that.\n\nYou can see where this is going. There are some characters which are commonly used as sound components of other characters, and 马 is one of them. But they don’t have to be just one type of component. In this case, 马 can also work as a meaning component in many other characters, and in these cases the meaning related to horses should be much more convincing than, say, my made-up story for 玛. A couple of examples (still phono-semantic) of 马 as a meaning component:\n\nThe character 骑 (qí), which originally meant to ride a horse, but later on extended its meaning to riding in general (horse, motorcycle, bike…). Here, it makes sense that 马 provides the meaning, while the other component, 奇 (qí), provides the sound. But wait, 奇 means ‘weird, unusual’… No, no, no, no, no, there is nothing weird about riding horses. Remember, there’s no need to force meanings—it just provides the sound.\nThe character 驴 (lǘ), which means donkey. Again, 马 provides the meaning (a donkey is similar to a horse), while 户 (hù, meaning ‘door’) provides the sound. Another witty joke? Okay, okay, no more jokes. Here 户 just gives the sound. But are hù and lǘ that similar sounds…? Well, you decide. But do they really need to be? Not necessarily. How come? Bear with me—we’ll go back to this example in the next section.\n\nThe sharp reader may have noticed that when the character works as a meaning component it appears on the left, and when it works as a sound component it appears on the right. This is a nice observation, and is true most of the time, so it can be used as a rule of thumb. However, always be careful because there are also exceptions where this pattern doesn’t hold.\nThe set of other characters where a specific character is used with the same function is called a series. In the case of 马, if you’re interested in more examples, the (probably non-exhaustive) series are:\n\nThe sound series: 吗 (ma), 妈 (mā), 玛 (mǎ), 码 (mǎ), 蚂 (mǎ), 骂 (mà).\nThe semantic series: 骑, 驴, 验, 驻, 骗, 驱, 驶, 驾, 冯, 驳, 骤, 驰, 闯, 骚, 骄, 骇, 驼, 驯, 骆, 笃, 骏, 骡, 驭, 驮, 驹, 骁.\n\nWhile the number of characters commonly used as meaning components is a rather sane amount, the number of those used as sound components is I think way too large. However, I don’t recommend trying to memorize either sound or semantic series of characters, since I think this is something you pick up naturally while encountering the characters themselves, and I would instead focus on learning the most common characters. For instance, from the sound and semantic series for 马 presented above, I could probably identify the function of 马 in them without knowing the actual character, and honestly, I don’t even know most of them, and it would be useless to try to do so just because they happen to be in the same series.\nAt the end of the last section, I mentioned Remembering the Hanzi as a book that seemed to ignore the phonetic aspect of characters. Thanks to some fellow learners, I also became aware of a similar book in Spanish by Pedro Ceinos titled Caracteres chinos (Chinese characters). This one actually does seem to introduce phonetic components, trying to group the characters by their series, but it always tries to enforce a meaning along with the sound. In the book’s introduction he explains this point of view, which he shares with a few other scholars, that no sound component comes without a slight hint of additional meaning to the overall character, effectively saying that almost all sound components are also meaning components at the same time. In addition, even though he mentions the concept of sound loan, in the actual characters where this happens he doesn’t identify it, relying only on meaning-based arguments.\nWhile most scholars believe that sound loans and sound components can stand on their own without adding any additional meaning—just like I tried to convey here—I still think authors like Ceinos are laudable for their hard work. He himself states that he’s no linguist, and his book is a result of his own experiences and beliefs, not necessarily aligned with other linguists’ point of view, which he is well aware of.\nBy now, I think you can’t deny that characters do speak, and sound is a crucial part of most of them. Unfortunately, you may still encounter some tricky characters whose voices you will struggle to understand. Although this can be quite challenging, we will devote the next section to at least try to decipher some of them."

    "section": "I think I’m just a bit empty",
    "text": "I think I’m just a bit empty\nIn this article, I’m focusing on simplified Chinese characters, which are used in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia, because that’s what most foreign learners start with, although I think experienced learners should know both simplified and traditional scripts. For example, 馬 is the traditional horse, while 马 is the simplified counterpart. Traditional characters are now mainly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Until the last century, they used to be a single script with maybe some character variants. We won’t try to address why and when they changed but rather what they changed and how these changes affected the understanding of the characters’ etymology.\nIn the previous section, we saw 驴 (lǘ) as an example of a phono-semantic character, where 户 (hù) gave the sound. While you could believe this works as a sound hint, another person might argue they are quite different. While in some cases the answer won’t be too satisfying, in this case, it’s quite simple. The traditional version of 驴 is 驢, and it turns out that the phonetic component’s (盧) sound is lú, which seems much more accurate. What happened here?\nEnter the world of empty components.\nWhen characters are simplified in one way or another, we’re doomed to lose some important information about them. In the previous example, the simplified component 户 can be known as both an empty component and a sound component. When simplifying characters, there are a few ways to do it. In this case, 户 doesn’t look excessively similar to 盧, nor does its sound, but together they somehow work as a simplified alternative. It can be called empty because it lost its original form, although it can also still be called a sound component because it still conveys a small sound hint. Simplifying characters often comes at a small cost—they become harder to understand logically.\nOther times, however, the simplified character works quite well without losing any significant parts. Let’s have a look at 认 (rèn), which can mean to know (part of the common compound 认识, rènshi, to know), and whose traditional character is 認.\n\nThe meaning component is 讠, which is the simplified version of 訁, meaning speech or something related to speech, giving the overall meaning to recognize, to admit, to know. One of the common simplification techniques is the regularization of cursive script. In fact, our lovely 马 also comes from a cursive variant! In some cases, this may still look similar to the original character and thus not be considered an empty component. Additionally, this simplification of some characters is consistent and always used this way when it works as a component in other characters.\nThe sound component is 人 (rén), which is totally not a reasonable simplification of 忍 (rěn) when it comes to its form, and can thus be considered an empty component. But keep in mind that its function was only as a sound hint, and the simplified alternative also does this pretty well, so it’s still a perfect sound component in the simplified character. We couldn’t ask for more. Also, remember that it’s fine for characters to work as either meaning or sound components, so in this case, just because 人 (meaning person) is almost always a meaning component (written as 亻) when part of other characters, you don’t need to force a meaning, it can also just work as a sound component.\n\nWas that okay? Well, now for the real mess… A character that often appears as an empty component in simplified characters is 又 (yòu), which would by itself be a depiction of a right hand, and looks something more similar to ㄡ when used as a component on the left side. Let’s see some examples in characters that may be familiar even to inexperienced Chinese learners:\n\nThe character 汉 (hàn), which can now reference the Han ethnic group, and is also part of the word 汉字 (hànzi), which means Chinese character. The 又 is an empty component and used to be the sound component 𦰩 (jiān) for the traditional variant 漢.\nThe character 难 (nán), which now means difficult just by pure sound loan. However, before that, its original meaning was a type of bird, with 又 being an empty component, simplification of 𦰩 (jiān) from the traditional variant 難. What? The same one as for 汉? Then it’s always like this? Ha! Not even close… Just wait and see the next ones.\nThe character 对 (duì), which now means yes or to face, among other things. Here the 又 is an empty component, simplification of 丵 and 土 in 對. It used to represent something related to developing the land, certainly not a sound component, maybe later a sound loan, but well, I won’t even try to explain this one because I don’t even get it myself.\nThe character 欢 (huān), which can mean happy. Here the 又 is—you guessed it—an empty component, simplification of 雚 (guàn), a sound component in the traditional… What? Well, somehow there are four different variants in the traditional script—歡, 驩, 懽, 讙. At least the sound component is the same in all of them…\nThe character 观 (guān), which means to observe. Your good friend 又 is yet again here trying to hide another sound component, this one again being 雚 (guàn), from the traditional variant 觀.\nThe character 鸡 (jī), which means chicken. You obviously know what function 又 plays, and it used to be 奚 (xī), a sound component for the two different variants 鷄 and 雞 of the traditional script.\n\nPhew! That really was a mess… And believe me there are like ten more characters where 又 is an empty component. When confronted with these difficulties, one could only think that maybe traditional characters are not that hard, since their components are completely more consistent.\nAnother unfortunate example of empty component can be found in 续 (xù), which can mean to continue. Here, 卖 (mài) is supposed to be the sound component. Well, this doesn’t sound quite similar… Its traditional form is 賣. It turns out that this is accurate for the single character 卖, but for our original one 续/續, the component 賣 was actually a simplification of 𧶠8 (you’d better zoom your screen if you can’t tell the difference), which is pronounced yù (much more similar to xù). Therefore, the sound component was quite accurate at some point in the past but turned into an empty component when it was simplified to the unrelated 賣, leaving us apparently with two different sounds for the same character. But now you know the reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Seal scripts for 续/續 (left), its actual sound component 𧶠 (middle) and the real 賣 (right)\n\n\n\nWe’re bringing the third act to a close, but there’s still one thing I want to talk about. In the first sentence of the article, I mentioned that characters can produce utterances of Old Chinese understood only by scholars. Although not directly related to empty components, this phenomenon can also disguise the real intentions, just like empty components do. I will try to explain what I meant with another example.\nConsider the character 也 (yě), which can now be used by sound loan to mean also or can be used as a particle9. The following is, again, a non-exhaustive list of its sound series: 他 (tā), 她 (tā), 牠 (tā), 地 (dì), 施 (shī), 池 (chí), 驰 (chí), 弛 (chí), 㐌 (yí), 匜 (yí). What? There are at least five different sounds here! What’s going on? Well, as almost always, the explanation can be quite simple, although not too satisfying.\nYou see, the sounds I showed you are the evolved modern sounds used in Mandarin for those characters. Thousands of years have passed, and spoken language evolves, so in the past, all of them would have had a similar sound, but they evolved into quite different sounds as time passed. For instance, some of them in Old Chinese are transcribed as l̥ʰaːl, l’els, hljal, l’aːl, l’al, hljalʔ, *lal. No, no, no, I’m not an expert in Old Chinese. I just though you would like to see the transcriptions yourself (see this phonetic series table). Unless we happen to be linguists ourselves, trained in the recognition of sound evolutions, this can just be a pain, but the only workaround is to acknowledge that these characters now have multiple voices, and we should take all of them into account. In the end, I guess we should just trust phonologists on this one."

    "text": "What a beautiful recital!\nBy now, I just hope I didn’t disappoint you when I claimed that Chinese characters can speak. I will be satisfied if I helped you train your ear just a tiny bit so that next time you encounter a character in the wild, you’ll have a higher chance of deciphering its voice. Let’s review what we learned here.\n\nThe sound loan phenomenon. Sometimes characters are borrowed just for their sound, as simple as that. They had an original meaning but it started being substituted by another one whose spoken word sounded the same, perhaps because it was too abstract of a concept to build a real pictogram for. Example: 四 (sì), originally to exhale, but now four (sì), because it had the same sound.\nThe phono-semantic compound. Roughly 80% of Chinese characters are built from two blocks: a meaning component, which gives a small hint for its meaning, and a sound component, which gives a small hint for how it’s read. Example: 妈 (mā), from 女 (woman), meaning component, and 马 (mǎ), sound component.\nThe empty component. Sometimes a component undergoes a simplification process that loses the clearer sight of its function in the character, usually conveying misleading information (mostly about its sound). Example: the excessively large number of unrelated components that 又 simplifies, like 汉, 难, 对, 欢, 观, 鸡, etc.\n\nYou’re now closer to becoming the conductor of the characters’ orchestra!\nIt was never my intention to make you think that learning and understanding Chinese characters is easy. Again, I still remember many years ago when I would immerse myself in playful stories and crafty mnemonics, with the sole purpose of getting my brain to remember a bit of these Japanese characters, which for some reason the Japanese thought it was a good idea to borrow from the Chinese hundreds of years ago. But at some point, I quit Heisig’s method out of pure boredom. I just wanted to read.\nI started changing my strategy when I met etymology—real etymology. Although there were still some parts of the puzzle that I couldn’t put together at times, overall, the process of understanding the characters became increasingly clear. I was really starting to hear (and enjoy) the characters’ voices to the point that they would end up feeling like a real alphabet—not much different from a Latin alphabet (ok, ok, just a few thousand more symbols), but still a millennia-old script system that initially built itself on the pretense of pictographic roots yet eventually kept growing systematically out of the need to represent abstract and complex concepts that would otherwise prove impossible without stealing some voices from here or there, recycling some characters all over again, building their own monumental hieroglyphs, inducing false fantasies in the marveled Westerners whose eyes dreamed of intellectual paintings, metaphysical and ideal pictorial algebras of the sciences and arts10, but still, down to its core, just another way to convey the power and beauty of language."

    "text": "Bonus: Character etymology resources\nPssst, the show is over…. If you keep reading this, I’m assuming I somehow caught your attention and you’re interested in knowing more about Chinese character etymology. After this long journey, I wouldn’t want you to conclude that I wrote the whole thing just as a shameless advertisement. This post was born for three main reasons:\n\nI barely ever write. But I wanted to give it a try. I just wanted to convey my interests in one topic and make an attempt at some serious writing. I can now say I enjoyed the process, and I hope I’ll keep writing in the future.\nI really got into real etymology when stumbling upon Outlier linguistics. Yeah, yeah, this is a paid service, blah, blah, blah. Since it has been so useful to me, I also wanted to present it briefly here but not in the main article, lest it would feel like I’m trying to sell you something. If you’re curious and willing to spend a bit of money, maybe you could also read the second subsection.\nOnce I got to grasp the characters’ voices myself, and also being aware of many people who still haven’t, I just wanted to put my two cents here and link them to this so that they could widen their vision a little bit.\n\nLet’s go to the resources!\n\nI’m not into pay-to-win, there’s plenty of free stuff on the internet\nYes, you’re right! I’m also fond of free resources, particularly when you’re a student and can’t afford any paid alternatives. I have some interesting ones for you that I also use from time to time:\n\nWiktionary: I wasn’t paying too much attention to it in the past, but believe me, I used it a lot when writing this article. When looking at entries for Chinese characters, I mainly use the section called Glyph origin, which is where you can find information like the one I present here. Look, for example, at this entry for 四, that I used to get some info for our sound loan introduction. There are probably not too many places with such a varied knowledge yet still detailed and quite accurate.\nHanziyuan: From 汉字源 (hànziyuán), meaning source of Chinese characters. This is a lifelong project by Richard Sears, popularly known as Uncle hanzi in China. He presents an astounding database of different versions of each character throughout history to see their evolution, along with additional data about the character, some related to its etymology and decomposition, though this information can sometimes feel a bit cryptic. The site can feel a bit old, but it’s still incredibly relevant. On the main page, there are also a few articles linked, but the links are broken. You can access them here. These are also an invaluable resource to get started in etymology and might also contain some additional explanations to better understand the sometimes cryptic information found on the site.\nDong Chinese dictionary: Okay, I must confess I haven’t used this one myself a lot, but probably because I only found it recently. I had a look at some dictionary entries and the origin explanations seem accurate. For instance, the entry for 四 is also in line with what we explained. It seems they take the origins seriously, as I read through this brief post. Incidentally, they also mention a resource I wasn’t aware of, which they describe as The most reliable and comprehensive source for character origins available online that I’ve found. I’ll include it here as well, again with our example for 四. That one is only in Chinese—fortunately, we live in a time when we can use tools like ChatGPT for accurate translations, so that shouldn’t be a problem.\nZhongwen: When talking about Chinese characters etymology, it’s impossible not to mention the Shuowen Jiezi, a character dictionary compiled by Xu Shen by the year 100 CE, which continues to be a relevant source to this day, even though some of its character explanations may now be considered outdated due to more recent research. Many tools try to break down characters into radicals, but doing so automatically usually results in a horrible and meaningless decomposition. On this site, you can navigate through a tree containing all characters and their inclusion relations as compiled manually by the Shuowen Jiezi. Each entry also contains a little explanation from the book itself and vocabulary examples. Keep in mind that the general tree is presented in traditional script, but the simplified version is also shown for each entry. Also, remember this is faithful to the Shuowen Jiezi, so some explanations may be outdated.\nShuowenjiezi: Tired of seeing short explanations from others that have read the Shuowen Jiezi for you? Then why not read it yourself? Okay, this is a hardcore resource. Here, you can access the entire Shuowen Jiezi in Chinese, along with commentaries from Duan Yucai’s annotated edition from 1815 and many other sources. You must really like etymology if you end up here. Again, if you don’t speak Chinese, you can just translate, not a big deal. Another thing that I find awesome (and I value in any dictionary) is that you can click any character in the text and it directly goes to the entry for that character. A paradise for linguists and etymology enthusiasts.\n\nLet’s acknowledge and appreciate the immense effort that so many people have put into compiling these resources and offering them for free. The world is a better place thanks to people like them.\n\n\nI value my time, take my money and give me the etymology\nAfter presenting such a useful list of free resources above, what are we left with? Can anything be better than that? Well, it depends on what you consider better. From those resources, apart from the Dong Chinese dictionary and, to a lesser extent, the Hanziyuan and the Zhongwen ones, in general, we can assume the vast majority of reliable etymology resources are not focused on Chinese learners, but rather on academia and research itself. Therefore, a Chinese language student might find them overwhelming (I’m aware you might have also felt like that when reading some parts of my article, and I’m sorry for that).\nAs much as I find all of this interesting, you would have a point if you said most of the information is quite unhelpful for learning the language. Unfortunately, I don’t remember when and how this happened, but at some point while I was learning Japanese I stumbled upon Outlier linguistics. I found myself watching their How Chinese characters actually work playlist and found it enlightening. Then I also read through some of their posts (the equivalents for Japanese, but I’m linking the ones for Chinese here), notably these—part 1 and part 2 (they have more nice free-to-read posts there if you’re interested).\nThe team at Outlier linguistics is made up of two people—Ash Henson, who has a PhD touching many fields of Chinese linguistics, and John Renfroe, who basically got into Sinology by accident but none could stop him until he found himself researching in classical Chinese, Chinese paleography, history and archaeology. Surely this pair must know something about Chinese character origins.\nThese two put their efforts into building a reliable dictionary of Chinese character etymology, keeping up to date with research, and trying to provide only the information necessary for Chinese learners to understand how the characters form, without necessarily going into too much detail. I found this systematic approach extremely convenient when I would be reading some text and want to know about an unfamiliar character. I can basically do it in less than 30 seconds from my phone (it integrates with the Pleco app).\nIf you believe you can pay back for a service that makes your life easier and you can afford it, I would highly recommend The Outlier Dictionary of Chinese Characters (the Essentials edition). The Expert edition contains much more information in the spirit of the more detailed research resources I presented before, but since this is also a lot of work to do, for now, they only have this extra information for a subset of the characters. In any case, an amazing feature is that, even in the Essentials edition, they include at least one reference to a technical book as a source for their claims, making it extremely reliable, and you can use that as a starting point if you really want to delve deeper. For learners, though, the Essentials edition is enough, just consider the Expert edition if you use the Essentials and you absolutely love it.\nFrom everything I presented, this is the resource I use the most without a doubt, and I also used it for some of the information included in this article (trying not to abuse it too much and also draw from open resources), so I hope the authors can forgive me by having devoted a whole subsection to their amazing dictionary. I won’t try to explain anything else; they already do it a hundred times better than me.\nLastly, for those of you learning Chinese, if you accept a little advice from another fellow learner, just go and read. Use all these resources just as a helpful secondary tool. Only access them when you find characters you don’t know. Don’t lose time trying to memorize words, or worse, individual characters. The best way to remember a word or character is through the frustration of not having been able to understand it in its context. And if you don’t understand the sentence, fear not! Tell ChatGPT to break it down and explain grammar points. You will grasp them in no time. Just go and read. Personally, I love graded readers. You can see some recommendations here (I’m particularly fond of the Chinese breeze series) and also learn more about extensive reading.\nEnjoy the journey.\n\n\nImages sourced from Wikimedia Commons, created by various contributors.

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThere is a subtle difference in wording here. First, characters like 一, 二 and 三 should be called ideograms, since they represent abstract ideas rather than pictures of real things. The other examples, however, should be called pictograms. While the terms pictogram and pictograph are sometimes used interchangeably, I would argue that pictograph is more precise when referring to ancient historical representations like cave paintings. In contrast, pictogram should be more appropriate when discussing characters within a writing system.↩︎\nI’ve heard this explanation many times, and while it might seem reasonable, early depictions in texts suggest otherwise. The pictogram appears to more closely resemble a human figure with breasts, either kneeling or standing—not sitting with crossed legs. In that case, the inferred gender would be better explained by the presence of breasts, which would likely be a more convincing argument for our confused student.↩︎\nIf you still didn’t know the characters and tried to guess them, you can check a table of the numbers here. If you’re interested in knowing a bit more about the numbers, this article is quite interesting.↩︎\nThis is one chapter from The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy by John DeFrancis, who seems to be controversial at times. I can’t tell you why, since I have only read this specific chapter, so I can’t speak for the rest, but at least this one I found quite inspiring.↩︎\nThe meaning actually comes as an abbreviation of 玛瑙 (mǎnǎo), from an earlier form, 马脑, which seems to be a mistranslation from Sanskrit, mistakenly understood as horse’s brain. So while originally even the horse part could have an explanation, here we only focus on the modern character. See the Wiktionary entry for more details.↩︎\nFor the reader not familiar with particles, just think of them as characters without a real concrete meaning, which are used to give a sentence or a part of it a certain function or emotion.↩︎\nFor the reader not familiar with tones, just keep in mind that the sound (what you say) is the same, but the intonation (how you say it) can be different. In Mandarin pinyin (the romanization of Chinese characters) we denote the intonations with different marks on the vowels.↩︎\nThis character is itself a simplification. Initially I wanted to show here the absolute beast that is the older character 𧸇, but most likely you can’t see it in your device unless you have a special font installed that supports old characters. It’s not your fault. If you can’t see the one in this footnote, you can get an idea of how it looks like in the images I included.↩︎\nFor the reader not familiar with particles, just think of them as characters without a real concrete meaning, which are used to give a sentence or a part of it a certain function or emotion.↩︎\nMetaphors from an excerpt of Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences, les arts, les moeurs, les usages, &c des Chinois, par les missionaries de Pekin, which I read in the article The ideographic myth.↩︎"
