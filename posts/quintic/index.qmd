# First degree

Here’s one for my kindergarten fans out there. Can you solve this equation?

$$ 
  x + a = 0
$$

_What's $x$?_

_What's $a$?_

...

Just kidding.

# Hint: Subtract $a$ from both sides... And try clicking me!

You might see boxes like this one throughout the article. If they have
an arrow at the right end, it means they have hidden content and you can
expand to see it by clicking on them.

Another thing worth mentioning. Writing a blog with aesthetically pleasant math
formulas is totally not easy. They have to look good in all kinds of devices.
For this reason, the safest workaround so that I don't risk someone seeing
absolute rubbish is to use horizontal scroll bars when the formula might
otherwise overflow the screen. This will rarely appear on a large monitor
but will be quite frequent in mobile devices, and I think there's no way
to force a scroll bar actually showing on mobile browsers, so I had to warn
you. If you feel like a formula is going out of the screen, please try to
scroll it even if you don't see a scroll bar! Here, an example:

$$ 
  \text{I am not one of those who fear to die, and I will not go quietly to the grave without telling the truth. My life's work will be understood in time. I have studied the theory of equations not as an isolated discipline but as part of a grander vision — the theory of groups. This new approach will illuminate the roots of algebraic problems and forever change mathematics. Though my life may be brief, my ideas will live on.}

# Second degree

## I know that one

Our _good ol'_ friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations...
Ok, yeah, they didn't formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them.
For us, this is a second degree equation:

$$ 
  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0
$$ 

Now it's your time to shine... You do remember that formula you were forced to
memorize in high school, don't you? Yes!

$$ 
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}  }{2a}
$$ 

Huh...

This is supposed to be an entry to [Summer of Math Exposition #4](https://some.3b1b.co/prize).
If you check this link, you'll find one part that goes like this:

Well, well, we just started and I'm already digging my own pit. I think I'll just wait for
someone else to address that in a whole post. If you happen to be one of those confused
students and you end up here, well, good luck with that. You have all your time. Don't
think the post will be an _easy_ read. But as for the prerequisites, I don't expect
from you anything more than the algebra and complex numbers you were taught in high school.

While you probably knew the above formula with the coefficients $a, b, c$ just like that,
I'm going to be using the same letter with subscripts, where $a_i$ is the coefficient
of the term $x^{i}$. Moreover, note that the coefficient $a_n$ of the highest degree term
(here $a_2$) is useless: the equation obtained from dividing everything by that
coefficient will have the same roots (prove it!). So the equation we'll work with is like this:

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0
$$ 

We haven't talked about which values can the coefficients of the equation take.
We could decide that they can be _any natural number_ ($0, 1, 2\dots$), _any integer_
($0, 1, -1, 2, -2\dots$), _any rational_... From now on, we'll assume they're
rational numbers. This is just a fancy term for fractions, the result of dividing
one integer by another. They are things like $0, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{57}{3}, -2$...
Of course, integers are also rationals because any integer $a$ can be written as $\frac{a}{1}$.

And why not choosing, say, just integers? Because we need some freedom with
the operations we do with coefficients. When we talked about dividing everything
by $a_2$, we were already considering that the new coefficients had to be at
least rational. Otherwise, depending on which division we perform, if we had
integers initially, we could now end up with something that isn't an integer
anymore. Thus, if we choose rational coefficients we're allowed to do basic
operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with them and always be sure that
the result will still be a rational number.

> — _Only yesterday_ (1991)

No, I'm not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an
excuse to include a part of [one of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/film/only-yesterday/),
where Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand 
the logic behind dividing fractions. _Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it
like that?_ This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception.
I also feel like this, even when I was doing my research to write this post.
Many suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it,
meaning that you shouldn't force yourself too far to get the logic behind some
concepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While
I do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I
will try my best in this article to build some intuition.

So just for the last time, let's rewrite the equation and the solution with the new
letters...

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$ are rationals}
$$ 

$$ 
  x = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^{2} -4 a_0} }{2}
$$ 

## But how did you get there?

_Shut up and memorize!_

Just joking. Let's see what we can do...

In the previous section we talked about equations and solutions. We might
sometimes still use that terminology, but we're also going to talk about
polynomials and roots. For our purposes, an equation can be expressed as
$p(x) = 0$, where $p(x)$ is a polynomial. In the quadratic example, the
polynomial would be $p(x) = x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$. A root of the polynomial
is any value that gives an output of $0$ when plugged as $x$ into that
polynomial. Therefore, a solution of the equation is a root of the polynomial.

Suppose we give names $x_1$, $x_2$ to our hypothetical roots. If something
is a root, as we just said, it should evaluate the polynomial to $0$. This
must work for both roots, so when factored out, the polynomial should look
like $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$. Here, if we change $x$ by either $x_1$ or $x_2$,
the result will be $0$ as expected. Now let's expand:

$$ 
  (x - x_1) (x - x_2) = x^{2} + (- x_1 - x_2) x + x_1 x_2
$$

But considering the original polynomial looked like $x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$,
that means we have the following equalities for our roots:

$$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2   &= a_0
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

The cool thing about them is that the result of adding or multiplying the roots
is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals), even if
the roots themselves might not be rational. 
In fact, knowing that, any weird expression made up of sums and products of roots, say
$\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^{3}}{3x_1 x_2} -4(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 x_2)^{6}$, will be _rationally
known_. I'm using these words on purpose, because that's how Galois
himself referred to quantities that ultimately evaluate to a rational number, even
if the operands themselves aren't necessarily rationals (like our roots). Keep this
cool observation in mind, you'll see why in just a while. 

So we have to figure out a formula for both roots. They're just two now, yes, but
you know this is going further, right? We will work with higher degree equations later.
Wouldn't it be cool if we could just find the value of _one_ thing, and then get
the value of all roots _for free_ just from that? Of course, besides this weird value,
we're also allowed to use the original coefficients of the polynomial, since they're
also known numbers.

I'll help you with that. There are probably a lot of values we could choose to find,
but I'll give you this one:

$$ 
  t = x_1 - x_2
$$ 

Of course you're now supposed to check that this does _encode_ everything about
the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Remember learning how to solve systems of equations in
high school? Reduction method, is that you?

$$ 
  \left.
  \begin{aligned}
      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\
      -a_1 &= x_1 + x_2
  \end{aligned}
  \right\}
  \Rightarrow
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - t}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

Do you see where this is going? Of course, we'll now try to find the value of $t$!
But why would this be easier? Well, instead of computing $t$, let's try with $t^{2}$:

$$ 
  t^{2} = (x_1 - x_2)^{2} = x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} - 2 x_1 x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^{2} - 4 x_1 x_2 
  \overset{\text{cool obs.}}{=} a_1^{2} - 4 a_0
$$

You do know what happened in the last step, right? The cool observation we made
earlier. We put everything in terms of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1 x_2$, so we can then
use the known rational coefficients, and we're done. We know what $t^{2}$ is, so
we can now pick a square root and have $t = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4a_0}$. Then getting
back the values of the original roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is routine substitution in
the equalities we stated earlier.

But before claiming our trophy in the form of a final result, let's expand our perspective
a bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we're sure that $t$ is a root, and we
know how to solve this new equation. That way we would get the value of $t$, just like
above, hoping that it would be easier than trying to solve the original equation.

So... How does such an equation look like? The one I'll show you won't be
too surprising, and you'll even think I'm just making fun of you, but keep in
mind I'm trying to prepare a recipe for future sections. Alright, the equation:

$$ 
  (x - t)(x + t) = 0
$$

Of course this equation makes sense. We already made a useful observation before.
If $t$ has to be a root, there must be a factor like $(x - t)$ out there.
The reason we also included $(x + t)$ is that now this product will give a neat
result, as you might expect from before. Yes, we just happen to know that because
we already calculated $t^{2}$ before, and this seems to be some circular
reasoning, but bear with me, this will be a useful reinterpretation later...

$$ 
\begin{array}{c}
  (x - t)(x + t) = 0 \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x^{2} - t^{2} = 0 \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x^{2} = t^{2} \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x = \sqrt{t^{2}} = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0} = t
\end{array}
$$ 

At this point you might be wondering why I never bother to write the typical sign
$\pm$ to represent that we could take either the positive or the negative value,
in this case, when taking the square root. At least for our quadratic example,
this is irrelevant! Why? Well, you just look back at the relations:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - t}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

If we take the positive value, that is, $t = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then we
get the solutions:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

If we instead take the negative value, i.e., $t = -\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then our
solutions will be:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 - \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 + \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

They're the same but swapped! So who cares? We just wanted to find the roots
in the first place, we didn't even define what should be called $x_1$ and what $x_2$,
there's just no difference. This also somehow addresses another question you might
have had. We want to find the value of the root $t$ from the new equation. _But how
do we even know which one of the roots is $t$?_ Well, as we just said, it turns out
any of them works... The more general answer to this question isn't that easy,
but will play a crucial role in our understanding of these equations, and we'll
get back to it later. _No spoilers_.

# First symmetry

I bet you know what's coming next... But before we try to tame that naughty cubic
equation, we need some polynomial machinery. We'll find some symmetries along
the way, I hope you're excited!

Let's recall the cool observation from previous section:

$$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2   &= a_0
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

The question is obvious... Can we find something similar for the cubic equation?

$$ 
  x^{3} + a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$ are rationals}
$$ 

We proceed the same way as for the quadratic. If the roots are $x_1$, $x_2$ and
$x_3$, we should be able to factor the equation like $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)$.
What do we get from here? You can check it yourself:

$$ 
  (x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3) = x^{3} - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) x^{2} + (x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3) x - x_1 x_2 x_3
$$ 

We got our relations!

$$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= -a_2 \\
  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 &= a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2 x_3 &= -a_3
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

I know you're seeing the pattern for the coefficients:

- Sum of all roots, negative sign
- Sum of all products of two different roots, positive sign
- Sum of all products of three different roots, negative sign
- ...

Now pay attention to this. If we have an equation of degree $n$, in coefficient
$a_i$, we have all possible different ways of choosing $n-i$ roots. What happens
if we swap any two of the roots? Of course, nothing! We rearranged some sums
and products, but since the order doesn't matter, and we were including all
possible products, we still have the same result! We say that these expressions
are _symmetric_ polynomials. A polynomial on the roots $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$
is _symmetric_ if it doesn't change no matter how we rearrange the roots.

The symmetric polynomials we've been working with actually have a special name:
they're called _elementary symmetric polynomials_. Any guess for why they have
this name? I'll give you a few examples to think.

Let's take for example this obviously symmetric polynomial:

$$ 
  x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2}
$$ 

Can we know its value? Let's rewrite it...

$$ 
  x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2} = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^{2} - 4(x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3) = a_2^{2} - 4 a_1
$$ 

Yes! That's a known rational. Let's try another symmetric polynomial:

$$ 
  x_1^{3} x_2 + x_2^{3} x_3 + x_3^{3} x_1
$$ 

_Oops!_ This is not a symmetric polynomial! Can you see why? It needs a small fix:

$$ 
  x_1^{3} x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2^{3} x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_3^{3}
$$ 

Yes, much better now. Can you prove this one is indeed symmetric? Hint: it's
enough to check swaps of two roots. That's because any rearrangement of roots
can be explained as a series of swaps of two roots. Now, is this also a known value?
Perhaps a product of familiar expressions...?

$$ 
  x_1^{3} x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2^{3} x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_3^{3} = (x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} + x_3^{2} )(x_1 x_2 x_3) = (a_2^{2} -4 a_1) \cdot a_0
$$ 

Well, this one also worked. Do you see where I'm going?

We were already observing in a previous section that any expression written
in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials has a known rational value,
no matter how complicated the expression may be. An expression written in terms
of elementary symmetric polynomials is of course symmetric, because each of
these terms is. But can we go further? 

_Any symmetric polynomial can be written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials._ 

I hope you agree this is not obvious at all. And the statement just like that
doesn't seem too interesting. Because we know that elementary symmetric
polynomials are known rational numbers, then we get this more insightful
result for free:

_Any symmetric polynomial on the roots is a known number._ 

We'll use this result a few times later. Of course, we should prove the first
statement about elementary symmetric polynomials. In Galois' time, this was
such a well-known fact that he didn't even bother including it in the
prerequisites for his memoir. (TODO: link proof or include in appendix)


# Third degree

## Déjà vu

Time for the cubic! Just to recap, this is what we have to start with:

$$ 
  x^{3} + a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$ are rationals}
$$ 

$$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= -a_2 \\
  x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 &= a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2 x_3 &= -a_3
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

Remember what we did in the [Second degree](#but-how-did-you-get-there) section?
We were discussing the possibility of finding a special value $t$ which could
encode all the information about our roots, in the sense that we could find
their values just from $t$ itself and other known values. For the quadratic
we used $t = x_1 - x_2$. Can we find such a value for the cubic?

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}

## Hint: Can you use the solutions of the equation $x^{3} = 1$?

Yes we can! Did you think about complex roots of unity? If you like following
the pattern, for the quadratic we have $t = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2$
where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ are the solutions of the equation $x^{2} = 1$. These
are of course $1$ and $-1$.

What are the solutions of $x^{3} = 1$? They're $1$, $\omega$ and $\omega^{2}$,
where $\omega$ is a complex root of $x^{2} + x + 1 = 0$. Then, again just
following the pattern, we could think of the following special value:

$$ 
  t = x_1 + \omega x_2 + \omega^{2} x_3
$$ 

This is just a hunch! In order to use this, we should actually show that all
$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ can be expressed in terms of this $t$ and other known values.

:::

Now that we got the value, it's time to show that the roots can be expressed
in terms of this $t$... Or that's what I thought while writing this. Too optimistic...
I'm not saying it's not possible, but it can be quite difficult to get those
formulas. Instead of trying to narrow down to a single value $t$, let's try
for a moment to use two values, the other being very similar to $t$. I'll help
you with this one.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

# Check these relations

$$ 
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  t &= x_1 + \omega x_2 + \omega^{2} x_3 \\
  t' &= x_1 + \omega^{2} x_2 + \omega x_3 \\
  -a_2 &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$ 

:::

Can you now find the roots by using $t$, $t'$, $\omega$ and the coefficients?

:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}

# Hint: Can you use the fact that $1 + \omega + \omega^{2} = 0$?

We can try to sum all three equations multiplied by specific coefficients
so that our root remains there and the other two are cancelled out
à la reduction method, because of the given relation of $\omega$.

Doing that, we get these formulas for the roots:

$$ 
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  x_1 &= \frac{t + t' - a_2}{3} \\
  x_2 &= \frac{\omega^{2} t + \omega t' - a_2}{3} \\
  x_3 &= \frac{\omega t + \omega^{2} t' - a_2}{3}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

:::

OK, so we can get the roots by using both $t$ and $t'$. Yes, I know what
you're thinking. We now have to find two values instead of one, but trust
me, this is justified, since these values seem so similar that I hope
we'll be able to find both of them _at the same time_.

You already know how this goes, now we have to build a polynomial for which
$t$ is a root, and hopefully, just hopefully, $t'$ will also be one of its
roots. Let's recall, or rather expand, the way we built the polynomial for
the quadratic case. I told you it would be helpful later, and the time has come.

Remember that we had $t = x_1 - x_2$. Our special polynomial for the quadratic
was this:

$$ 
  (x - t)(x + t) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x + (x_1 - x_2)) = (x - (x_1 - x_2))(x - (x_2 - x_1))
  = x^{2} - ((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1)) x + (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)
$$ 

You already know what the actual polynomial is, but I left it in this last form
to notice something: the coefficients are symmetric polynomials on the roots!
If you try swapping $x_1$ and $x_2$ in both expressions $((x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1))$
and $(x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_1)$, you get the same result. In the previous section,
we just saw that all symmetric polynomials on the roots are actually known values.
They're made from the coefficients of the original equation, which were rational,
so we got a new equation with rational coefficients. 

Of course, there _is_ one concern. Perhaps this new equation is just as hard to
solve as the original one, and then we did something completely useless. While
that's a possibility, we were hoping that our choice of $t$ would make the new
equation sufficiently easy to solve. In the case of the quadratic, you know that
this was true because we were able to lose the term of $x$, and get a simpler
quadratic $x^{2} - t^{2} = 0$, which only requires to take a square root to solve.

We saw the coefficients we got in the end are symmetric polynomials, but we could
have deduced that from the start, from the way we defined the polynomial as a
product. Yes, in the quadratic example it was easier to see why we would benefit
from choosing both $t$ and $-t$ (sum times difference is the difference of squares).
Another way to look at this is that $-t$ is the result of swapping the roots in $t$:

$$ 
  (x - (\text{t with no rearrangement}))(x - (\text{t with roots swapped}))
$$ 

This form is telling us that this is a symmetric polynomial _on the roots_, and
therefore, that its final coefficients will be known rational values. Can you see
why? I'll let you figure that out, because now it's your turn again... Can you
use this idea to find a suitable new polynomial for the cubic, for which $t$ and
$t'$ are two of its roots? Just to remember, these are their expressions:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      t &= x_1 + \omega x_2 + \omega^{2} x_3 \\
      t' &= x_1 + \omega^{2} x_2 + \omega x_3
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \quad
  \text{The value $\omega$ is such that $1+\omega+\omega^{2} = 0$}
$$ 

Come on, try to find the polynomial!
