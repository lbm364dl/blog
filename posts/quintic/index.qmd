# Second degree

## Dancing with symbols

Our _goold ol'_ friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations...
Ok, yeah, they didn't formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them.
For us, this is a second degree equation:

$$ 
  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0
$$ 

Now it's your time to shine... You do remember that formula you were forced to
memorize in high school, don't you? Yes!

$$ 
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}  }{2a}
$$ 

Huh...

This is supposed to be an entry to [Summer of Math Exposition #4](https://some.3b1b.co/prize).
If you check this link, you'll find one part that goes like this:

Well, well, we just started and I'm already digging my own pit. I'll wait for someone
else to address that in a whole post. We're going to be using these letters a lot so
I'll try briefly... If you're already fine with that, you can skip to the [next section](#but-how-did-you-get-there).

- Letters from the end of the alphabet will represent values that we don't know.
  These would be $x$, $y$, $z$... But I'm pretty sure we're only going to use $x$,
  which means there's really only one unknown value to be found.
- Letters from the start of the alphabet will represent _actual numbers_, but like _any_
  number. A _specific_ quadratic formula could be something like $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = 0$ or
  $x^{2} + 5x - 2 = 0$, but when we write $x^{2} + bx + c = 0$, we mean that we could
  just write anything where $b$ and $c$ are. We're essentially working with all the
  quadratic equations at the same time! So these letters could typically be $a$, $b$,
  $c$...

Regarding this second point, throughout the post, instead of $a$, $b$, $c$... we're
probably going to use the same letter but with subscripts, like $a_2$, $a_1$, $a_0$..., where:

- $a_0$ is the coefficient for $x^{0}$
- $a_1$ is the coefficient for $x^{1}$ 
- $a_2$ is the coefficient for $x^{2}$
- ...
- $a_i$ is the coefficient for $x^{i}$
- ...

And yes, this $i$ above also represents _any_ subscript of a coefficient. It's a faster
way to refer to all of them, it just means that you can substitute $i$ for any number
and the sentence still holds true. Naturally, you don't have to find an explanation for
this, it's just one of the thousands of conventions mathematicians use as part of
their economy of language. I will try to be rather verbose in this post, but I know
I already have one foot in this jargon myself, so I'm sorry if I fail at times.

Now that we know this, let's rewrite the quadratic equation so that we're all at the same page:

$$ 
  a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x^{1} + a_0 x^{0} = a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0
$$ 

Let's simplify even more. The coefficient $a_2$ is quite useless. If it were zero,
this wouldn't be a quadratic equation at all. So we can divide everything by $a_2$
safely, and we would have:

$$ 
  x^{2} + \frac{a_1}{a_2} x + \frac{a_0}{a_2} = x^{2} + b_1 x + b_0 = 0
$$ 

_Didn't you say we were going to use the letter $a$?_ Yes... I'm just trying to tease you.
Who cares if it's $a$'s or $b$'s, really. Ok, so the quadratic formula is now like this:

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0
$$ 

_Are you kidding me? This is clearly wrong._ Why? I told you letters don't matter.
These just represent _anything_. This $a_1$ isn't the one you previously saw in
$\frac{a_1}{a_2}$, and similarly, the $a_0$ isn't the one you saw in $\frac{a_0}{a_2}$.
I'm kind of cheating. I know this is confusing. This is why mathematicians also use
apostrophes along with the same letters to represent that they're something similar,
they still represent an arbitrary value but they were built from some previous letters
with the same name. Therefore, we could instead say that $a_1' = \frac{a_1}{a_2}$ and
$a_0' = \frac{a_0}{a_2}$, so that the quadratic formula can be written as
$x^{2} + a_1' x + a_0' = 0$. Here, $a_1'$ is read _a 1 prime_, and similarly, $a_0'$ is
read _a 0 prime_.

One last caveat. The word _anything_ can actually mean anything... I'm so funny. No,
really. I mean, we have to establish a set of values that these letters can actually take.
We could decide that it can be _any natural number_ ($0, 1, 2\dots$), _any integer_ ($0, 1, -1, 2, -2\dots$),
_any rational_... For us, the original equation we're going to consider will be any
rational number. Rational numbers are what you may know as fractions, the result of dividing
one integer by another. Rational numbers are things like $0, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{57}{3}, -2$...
Of course, integers are also contained in rationals because any integer $a$ can be
written as $\frac{a}{1}$.

In the simplification we did at the start by dividing everything by $a_2$, we were
already considering that the new coefficients had to be at least rational. Imagine
the original coefficients were only allowed to be integers. Since they could be
_any integer_, the result of $\frac{a_0}{a_2}$ might not be an integer anymore,
e.g. if $a_0 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$, but it will always be a rational. So we are allowed
to do basic operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with the rational
coefficients and be sure that the result will still be a rational number.

No, I'm not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an
excuse to include a part of [one of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/film/only-yesterday/),
where Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand 
the logic behind dividing fractions. _Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it
like that?_ This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception.
I also feel like this, even when I was doing my research to write this post.
Many suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it,
meaning that you shouldn't force yourself too far to get the logic behind some
concepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While
I do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I
will try my best in this article to build some intuition.

So just for the last time, let's rewrite the equation and the solution with the new
letters...

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$ are rationals}
$$ 

$$ 
  x = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^{2} -4 a_0} }{2}
$$ 

## But how did you get there?

_Shut up and memorize!_

Just joking. Let's see what we can do...

Suppose we give names $x_1$, $x_2$ to our hypothetical roots. Then we should
be able to write the polynomial from our original equation as

$$ 
  (x - x_1) (x - x_2) = x^{2} + (- x_1 - x_2) x + x_1 x_2
$$

But that means we have the following equalities for our roots:

$$ 
\begin{cases}
  x_1 + x_2 &= - a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2 &= a_0
\end{cases}
$$ 

The cool thing about them is that the result of adding or multiplying the roots
is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals), even if
the roots might not be rational. Maybe we can generalize this and find even
more expressions in terms of the roots that are actually just rational numbers,
if we can rewrite them in terms of sums of products of the roots. Just keep this
in mind. Now let's go for another seemingly weird move.

Let's define another _value_, that we might or might not really know:

$$ 
  t = x_1 - x_2
$$ 

This _t_ has a special property: it _encodes_ everything about the roots $x_1$
and $x_2$! What I mean is that, if we ever get to know the actual value of $t$,
we could get back our roots by just using $t$! How come? Well...

$$ 
  \begin{cases}
      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\
      -a_1 &= x_1 + x_2
  \end{cases}
  = 
  \begin{cases}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - t}{2}
  \end{cases}
$$ 

Do you see where this is going? Of course, we'll try to find the value of $t$!
But why would this be easier? Well, instead of computing $t$, let's try with $t^{2}$:

$$ 
  t^{2} = (x_1 - x_2)^{2} = x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} - 2 x_1 x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^{2} - 4 x_1 x_2 = a_1^{2} - 4 a_0
$$

We do know the value of $t^{2}$ since it's made up of the coefficients of the original
equation, which are known. So knowing $t$ and consequently the roots is now just routine
substitution. But before showing the cool final result of our proof, let's shift the perspective
a bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we're sure that $t$ is a root, and we
know how to solve this new equation. In the end we calculate the value of $t$, just like
above, hoping that it would be easier. Which equation can we choose?
