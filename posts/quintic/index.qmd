# First degree

Here’s one for my kindergarten fans out there. Can you solve this equation?

$$ 
  x + a = 0
$$

_What's $x$?_

_What's $a$?_

...

Just kidding.

# Second degree

## Dancing with symbols

Our _good ol'_ friends the Babylonians were already solving second degree equations...
Ok, yeah, they didn't formulate them in the same way, but they really could solve them.
For us, this is a second degree equation:

$$ 
  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0
$$ 

Now it's your time to shine... You do remember that formula you were forced to
memorize in high school, don't you? Yes!

$$ 
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}  }{2a}
$$ 

Huh...

This is supposed to be an entry to [Summer of Math Exposition #4](https://some.3b1b.co/prize).
If you check this link, you'll find one part that goes like this:

Well, well, we just started and I'm already digging my own pit. I'll wait for someone
else to address that in a whole post. We're going to be using these letters a lot so
I'll try briefly... If you're already fine with that, you can skip to the [next section](#but-how-did-you-get-there).

- Letters from the end of the alphabet will represent values that we don't know.
  These would be $x$, $y$, $z$... But I'm pretty sure we're only going to use $x$,
  which means there's really only one unknown value to be found.
- Letters from the start of the alphabet will represent _actual numbers_, but like _any_
  number. A _specific_ quadratic formula could be something like $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = 0$ or
  $x^{2} + 5x - 2 = 0$, but when we write $x^{2} + bx + c = 0$, we mean that we could
  just write anything where $b$ and $c$ are. We're essentially working with all the
  quadratic equations at the same time! So these letters could typically be $a$, $b$,
  $c$...

Regarding this second point, throughout the post, instead of $a$, $b$, $c$... we're
probably going to use the same letter but with subscripts, like $a_2$, $a_1$, $a_0$..., where:

- $a_0$ is the coefficient for $x^{0}$
- $a_1$ is the coefficient for $x^{1}$ 
- $a_2$ is the coefficient for $x^{2}$
- ...
- $a_i$ is the coefficient for $x^{i}$
- ...

And yes, this $i$ above also represents _any_ subscript of a coefficient. It's a faster
way to refer to all of them, it just means that you can substitute $i$ for any number
and the sentence still holds true. Naturally, you don't have to find an explanation for
this, it's just one of the thousands of conventions mathematicians use as part of
their economy of language. I will try to be rather verbose in this post, but I know
I already have one foot in this jargon myself, so I'm sorry if I fail at times.

Now that we know this, let's rewrite the quadratic equation so that we're all at the same page:

$$ 
  a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x^{1} + a_0 x^{0} = a_2 x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0
$$ 

Let's simplify even more. The coefficient $a_2$ is quite useless. If it were zero,
this wouldn't be a quadratic equation at all. So we can divide everything by $a_2$
safely, and we would have:

$$ 
  x^{2} + \frac{a_1}{a_2} x + \frac{a_0}{a_2} = x^{2} + b_1 x + b_0 = 0
$$ 

_Didn't you say we were going to use the letter $a$?_ Yes... I'm just trying to tease you.
Who cares if it's $a$'s or $b$'s, really. Ok, so the quadratic formula is now like this:

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0
$$ 

_Are you kidding me? This is clearly wrong._ Why? I told you letters don't matter.
These just represent _anything_. This $a_1$ isn't the one you previously saw in
$\frac{a_1}{a_2}$, and similarly, the $a_0$ isn't the one you saw in $\frac{a_0}{a_2}$.
I'm kind of cheating. I know this is confusing. This is why mathematicians also use
apostrophes along with the same letters to represent that they're something similar,
they still represent an arbitrary value but they were built from some previous letters
with the same name. Therefore, we could instead say that $a_1' = \frac{a_1}{a_2}$ and
$a_0' = \frac{a_0}{a_2}$, so that the quadratic formula can be written as
$x^{2} + a_1' x + a_0' = 0$. Here, $a_1'$ is read _a 1 prime_, and similarly, $a_0'$ is
read _a 0 prime_.

One last caveat. The word _anything_ can actually mean anything... I'm so funny. No,
really. I mean, we have to establish a set of values that these letters can actually take.
We could decide that it can be _any natural number_ ($0, 1, 2\dots$), _any integer_ ($0, 1, -1, 2, -2\dots$),
_any rational_... For us, the original equation we're going to consider will be any
rational number. Rational numbers are what you may know as fractions, the result of dividing
one integer by another. Rational numbers are things like $0, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{57}{3}, -2$...
Of course, integers are also contained in rationals because any integer $a$ can be
written as $\frac{a}{1}$.

In the simplification we did at the start by dividing everything by $a_2$, we were
already considering that the new coefficients had to be at least rational. Imagine
the original coefficients were only allowed to be integers. Since they could be
_any integer_, the result of $\frac{a_0}{a_2}$ might not be an integer anymore,
e.g. if $a_0 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$, but it will always be a rational. So we are allowed
to do basic operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) with the rational
coefficients and be sure that the result will still be a rational number.

No, I'm not going to explain how to divide fractions today. I just wanted an
excuse to include a part of [one of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/film/only-yesterday/),
where Taeko, the protagonist, shows her frustration of not being able to understand 
the logic behind dividing fractions. _Ok, I get what I have to do, but why is it
like that?_ This is a recurring theme in many fields, and math is no exception.
I also feel like this, even when I was doing my research to write this post.
Many suggest that math is something you start understanding while you do it,
meaning that you shouldn't force yourself too far to get the logic behind some
concepts until you have already spent quite some time working with them. While
I do agree with this, and is partly how I accept my own knowledge gaps, I
will try my best in this article to build some intuition.

So just for the last time, let's rewrite the equation and the solution with the new
letters...

$$ 
  x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \text{ where $a_0$, $a_1$ are rationals}
$$ 

$$ 
  x = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^{2} -4 a_0} }{2}
$$ 

## But how did you get there?

_Shut up and memorize!_

Just joking. Let's see what we can do...

In the previous section we talked about equations and solutions. We might
sometimes still use that terminology, but we're also going to talk about
polynomials and roots. For our purposes, an equation can be expressed as
$p(x) = 0$, where $p(x)$ is a polynomial. In the quadratic example, the
polynomial would be $p(x) = x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$. A root of the polynomial
is any value that gives an output of $0$ when plugged as $x$ into that
polynomial. Therefore, a solution of the equation is a root of the polynomial.

Suppose we give names $x_1$, $x_2$ to our hypothetical roots. If something
is a root, as we just said, it should evaluate the polynomial to $0$. This
must work for both roots, so when factored out, the polynomial should look
like $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$. Here, if we change $x$ by either $x_1$ or $x_2$,
the result will be $0$ as expected. Now let's expand:

$$ 
  (x - x_1) (x - x_2) = x^{2} + (- x_1 - x_2) x + x_1 x_2
$$

But considering the original polynomial looked like $x^{2} + a_1 x + a_0$,
that means we have the following equalities for our roots:

$$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  x_1 + x_2 &= -a_1 \\
  x_1 x_2   &= a_0
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

The cool thing about them is that the result of adding or multiplying the roots
is again a rational number (because our coefficients were rationals), even if
the roots themselves might not be rational. 
In fact, knowing that, any weird expression made up of sums and products of roots, say
$\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^{3}}{3x_1 x_2} -4(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 x_2)^{6}$, will be _rationally
known_. I'm using these words on purpose, because that's how Galois
himself referred to quantities that ultimately evaluate to a rational number, even
if the operands themselves aren't necessarily rationals (like our roots). Keep this
cool observation in mind, you'll see in just a while. 

So we have to figure out a formula for both roots. They're just two now, yes, but
you know this is going further, right? We will work with higher degree equations later.
Wouldn't it be cool if we could just find the value of _one_ thing, and then get
the value of all roots _for free_ just from that? Of course, besides this weird value,
we're also allowed to use the original coefficients of the polynomial, since they're
also known numbers.

I'll help you with that. There are probably a lot of values we could choose to find,
but I'll give you this one, which we call $t$:

$$ 
  t = x_1 - x_2
$$ 

Of course you're now supposed to check that this does _encode_ everything about
the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Remember learning how to solve systems of equations in
high school? Reduction method, is that you?

$$ 
  \left.
  \begin{aligned}
      t &= x_1 - x_2 \\
      -a_1 &= x_1 + x_2
  \end{aligned}
  \right\}
  \Rightarrow
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - t}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

Do you see where this is going? Of course, we'll now try to find the value of $t$!
But why would this be easier? Well, instead of computing $t$, let's try with $t^{2}$:

$$ 
  t^{2} = (x_1 - x_2)^{2} = x_1^{2} + x_2^{2} - 2 x_1 x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^{2} - 4 x_1 x_2 
  \overset{\text{cool obs.}}{=} a_1^{2} - 4 a_0
$$

You do know what happened in the last step, right? The cool observation we made
earlier. We put everything in terms of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1 x_2$, so we can then
use the known rational coefficients, and we're done. We know what $t^{2}$ is, so
we can now pick a square root and have $t = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4a_0}$. Then getting
back the values of the original roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is routine substitution in
the equalities we stated earlier.

But before claiming our trophy in the form of a final result, let's expand our perspective
a bit. Suppose we craft another equation, of which we're sure that $t$ is a root, and we
know how to solve this new equation. That way we would get the value of $t$, just like
above, hoping that it would be easier than trying to solve the original equation.

So... How does such an equation look like? The one I'll show you won't be
too surprising, and you'll even think I'm just making fun of you, but keep in
mind I'm trying to prepare a recipe for future sections. Alright, the equation:

$$ 
  (x - t)(x + t) = 0
$$

Please don't be confused about the use of $x$. The letter $x$ here again
represents an unknown value, a solution to the equation, but to _this_ equation,
not the original one! So of course this equation makes sense. We already made
a useful observation before. If $t$ has to be a root, there must be a factor like
$(x - t)$ out there. The reason we also included $(x + t)$ is that now this
product will give a neat result, as you might expect from before. Yes, we
just happen to know that because we already calculated $t^{2}$ before, and
this seems to be some circular reasoning, but bear with me, this will be a
useful reinterpretation later...

$$ 
\begin{array}{c}
  (x - t)(x + t) = 0 \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x^{2} - t^{2} = 0 \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x^{2} = t^{2} \\
  \Downarrow \\
  x = \sqrt{t^{2}} = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0} = t
\end{array}
$$ 

At this point you might be wondering why I never bother to write the typical sign
$\pm$ to represent that we could take either the positive or the negative value,
in this case, when taking the square root. At least for our quadratic example,
this is irrelevant! Why? Well, you just look back at the relations:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + t}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - t}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

If we take the positive value, that is, $t = \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then we
get the solutions:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 + \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 - \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

If we instead take the negative value, i.e., $t = -\sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}$, then our
solutions will be:

$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      x_1 &= \frac{-a_1 - \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2} \\
      x_2 &= \frac{-a_1 + \sqrt{a_1^{2} - 4 a_0}}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$ 

They're the same but swapped! So who cares? We just wanted to find the roots
in the first place, we didn't even define what should be called $x_1$ and what $x_2$,
there's just no difference. This also somehow addresses another question you might
have had. We want to find the value of the root $t$ from the new equation. _But how
do we even know which one of the roots is $t$?_ Well, as we just said, it turns out
any of them works... The more general answer to this question isn't that easy,
but will play a crucial role in our understanding of these equations, and we'll
get back to it later. _No spoilers_.
