Roughly 80% of Chinese characters can _speak_—whether in something close to
Mandarin or in the ancient utterances of Old Chinese, understood only by
scholars. They're not particularly talkative, capable of producing just one or
two syllables in their own language. In fact, the only thing they were ever
taught to say, is their own name.

> **Teacher**: Chinese characters are not difficult. They are just pictograms
[^1]—simplified drawings representing real things. Try to guess what these
mean: 一, 二, 三, 火, 雨, 山, 木...
>
> **Student**: Oh! Clearly those first three represent the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
I can imagine 火 represents _fire_, perhaps 雨 represents _rain_. The
character 山 is definitely a crown, so maybe it stands for a king...? Hmmm...
I think 木 is a depiction of a slingshot—yeah, someone is aiming and about to shoot.
>
> **Teacher**: I can see where you're coming from, but 山 actually represents
a mountain. And as for 木—well, you've got quite the imagination, but it's
just a tree. Surely you see that 女 shows a woman with her legs crossed,
right? [^2]
>
> **Student**: Huh... well, now that you mention it, and with a bit of
imagination... Let's also pretend men didn't like crossing their legs in
ancient times.
>
> **Teacher**: Ok, let's try a harder example: the character 玛, which can
mean _agate_, a type of precious stone. It consists of two parts: 𤣩 and 马.
> - The first part 𤣩 comes from 玉, which depicts three pieces of jade strung
together on a string. When used in other characters, it takes the form 𤣩
and typically relates to gems.
> - The second part 马 is the simplified version of 馬, which is a depiction of a
horse. 
>
> In ancient times, some traders would showcase their gemstones—like agates—at
markets. But some buyers would question their authenticity. To gain trust,
traders would also show off their magnificent horses, symbols of wealth and
elegance, just like the gems themselves.
>
> **Student**: Wow, seems like these ancient Chinese people also had some
imagination... Anyway, how is this story specific to _agate_? It could just as
well apply to any other precious stone, right? And wait—how do you even
pronounce this character? We haven't even talked about pronouncing characters!
Such a cool story for the meaning, but maybe there's more to it?

If you've ever started learning Chinese, you might find the previous dialogue
somewhat relatable. If you've delved deeper, perhaps you already know that
characters can _speak_. Or maybe you still think of them as mute individuals,
silent figures that only convey meaning (I made up the story for 玛—guessed
it?). Of course, you could argue that this dialogue is exaggerated and that
teachers do mention that phonetic parts of characters are a thing, and you
would have a point. However, this is often only briefly touched upon, whereas
pictogram-based explanations tend to dominate. Only these, in turn, are the
ones that stick with students, shaping their perception of Chinese characters
for the rest of their journey.

Consider the following set of characters: 七, 十, 五, 三, 一, 六, 九, 四, 八,
二. These are the Chinese characters for the numbers from 1 to 10, but
shuffled in a random order. Would you be able to guess them if you didn't
already know them? From the previous dialogue, you should already know
that 一, 二 and 三 are 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As for the rest, if by any
chance you have some strong detective-like intuition and manage to figure them
out, I would be delighted to know how[^3]. For the rest of us, they're just a
bunch of strokes put together, following no apparent easy _ideogram_
explanation like for the first three numbers. Why these choices? Open your
ears wide—you will slowly start unraveling the hidden voices of the
characters!

## Excuse me, can I borrow your sound?

Okay, our previous game wasn't fair. Instead, I could have told you that the
number 4 is written as 亖, and you would, of course, believe me. How is
this not better than 四? What is 四 even representing? 

You see, Chinese people like their characters stylized. The character 亖
was once the representation of the number 4 in ancient times, but they must
have felt that four horizontal strokes were too much—not exactly in line with
their idea of beautiful characters. They could have chosen other visual ways
to represent numbers (_good ol'_ tally marks?), but instead, they took
another ingenious path. 

Enter the world of _sound loan_.

Because spoken language is older than written language, people already had a
_sound_ for the number 4 (_sì_). Incidentally, the _sound_ for 'to exhale'
was also _sì_—believe it or not, it was originally represented by 四 (trust
me, this is a depiction of a nose). Can you connect the dots? There was a
character, 四, that already had a meaning (_to exhale_), but people also
started using it for another meaning (_the number 4_) just because the
sounds matched. Now, for the number 4, the character only tells us how to
say it, there's no direct meaning involved! As is often the case with these
examples, over time, the original meaning of 'to exhale' gradually fell out
of use. It was later represented by 呬, with a _mouth_ (口) component added
to reinforce the meaning and distinguish it from 四. Even so, the character
呬 eventually became obsolete too, with speakers now opting instead for
compound words (terms made of at least two characters).

Evolution of number 4 (leftmost) to borrowed _to exhale_, nose depiction (the rest)

::::

No matter if the explanation for the number 4 left you satisfied or
disappointed, the truth is that the characters for the rest of the numbers
follow the same concept of _sound loan_. We could now discuss the next number,
the number 5, which is represented by the character 五 (wǔ). A sharp reader
might try to explain that this character is made up of five strokes, so maybe
there were five individual lines at some point in the past. In fact, a more
experienced Chinese learner would know that the character is actually written
with four strokes (one with a bend), not five, and even if we look at early
texts, there are only four well defined strokes, following a crisscross
pattern, which was also the original meaning. While there are some theories
that try to explain this choice, the most logical one is still—you guessed
it—just a _sound loan_. The sound for the number 5 happened to match, so the
character was borrowed just for its sound.

:::

Evolution of the character 五 now used to represent the number 5

::::

This pattern of borrowing a character only for its sound and using it to
represent a meaning completely unrelated to the original character's meaning
is quite common in general—it's not limited to numbers. For instance, another
one of the first characters Chinese learners see is 我 (wǒ), which is used
as the first person singular pronoun ('I' in English). This character is
a depiction of a trident-like weapon. You already know where this is going,
don't you? Yes, just a _sound loan_.

I am not a linguist myself, but I am at a point where I find knowing the
_real_ explanations (i.e., the most widely accepted by scholars) much more
satisfying than coming up with a mnemonic story to remember the character
and its meaning, even if the latter seems easier. In the end, we still have
to learn by repetition. Anyway, I have nothing against mnemonics themselves
(Heisig enjoyers, _u there_?), as long as we acknowledge that the vast majority
are made up. However, there is usually only a really thin line between these
stories and [_folk etymology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology)
(people thinking these stories are the real origins of the meanings). Maybe
some readers have heard the popular explanation for 我—that it depicts a
hand (手) holding a weapon (戈) to protect oneself (我). While the story
sounds reasonable, scholars believe it to be a reinterpretation of the
character into more commonly understood concepts, which is why it falls
into _folk etymology_. In contrast, our sound loan explanation is simple but
less sticky, which is why many people don't find it useful.

Many students who start learning Chinese feel attracted by the characters so
much so that they often fall for
[_The ideographic myth_](https://pinyin.info/readings/texts/ideographic_myth.html)[^4].
Thus, methods like Heisig's _Remembering the Hanzi_ disregard character
pronunciation, as if it were acceptable for students to turn a deaf ear to
the characters' voices. I myself used _Remembering the Kanji_—the equivalent
for Japanese characters—when I was learning Japanese, and memorized hundreds
of them without knowing how to pronounce them. There is actually a part 2
of _Remembering the Kanji_ which focuses on mnemonic stories for how characters
are read, although as far as I know this doesn't exist in _Remembering the
Hanzi_, making it rather detrimental.

I started with a popular statistic about 80% of Chinese characters being able
to _speak_. This was to catch the reader's attention, because in reality this
percentage doesn't include the _sound loan_ characters introduced in this
section. While not many people know about the widespread use of _sound loan_ in
common characters, others do know about another special type—the one actually
being referred to when talking about the 80%—and potentially the most
important when trying to decipher the characters' voices.

## But my life isn't totally meaningless

Of course, let's not forget that at some point in ancient times, before some
were borrowed for their sound, all characters did have an original meaning.
Recall, for example, the character 马 introduced in the dialogue, which is a
depiction of a horse, as a simplified version of 馬. Do you still not see the
horse here? Oh well...

:::

Evolution of the 馬 character from left to right

::::

Now the meaning argument goes like this: Chinese characters, when part of
larger characters, still contribute their meaning as part of a compound
explanation. If we believe this, then naturally, we must find a reasonable
story to connect the pieces in the character 玛—we have to find a way to
connect the seemingly unrelated meanings of its components _gemstone_ and
_horse_. While certain characters composed only of meaning components—known
as _associative compounds_—are widely accepted, we shouldn't force this idea
onto the vast majority of compound characters, despite many attempts to do so.

Enter the world of _phono-semantic_ compounds.

Our example 玛 (_agate_[^5]) has a much simpler explanation—though for some,
a less satisfying one. The character 马 is pronounced mǎ, and, well, the
character 玛 is pronounced—yeah, you guessed it—also mǎ. The character has a
_meaning_ component, 𤣩, which provides a small hint—indicating that it's a
kind of _gemstone_—and a _sound_ component, which suggests its pronunciation
but doesn't necessarily contribute to its meaning. This is how _phono-semantic_
characters work. Believe it or not, you now more or less understand how 80%
of Chinese characters work.

Now that we know 马 can be used as a sound component, a Chinese learner
might recall two other characters that are taught right at the start.

- The character 吗 (ma). This is used as a sentence-final particle[^6] to
denote yes-no questions. Particles are often another example of
_phono-semantic_ characters. They typically include the mouth 口 (i.e. _speech_)
as the meaning component, alone with the sound component. In the case of 吗, our
lovely horse provides the sound. Just note that the tone[^7] is not the same,
but as I mentioned earlier, the sound component serves as a hint and doesn't
need to be exactly spot on.
- The character 妈 (mā), which means _mother_, usually also doubled as 妈妈.
From the previous dialogue, you now know that 女 means _woman_. _What do
women have to do with horses?_ Oh, come on, Chinese characters are not a
joke... Fortunately, by this point, you can already understand how this
works: a _mother_ is a _woman_, and 马 provides the sound—it's as simple as
that.

You can see where this is going. There are some characters which are commonly
used as sound components of other characters, and 马 is one of them. But they
don't have to be just one type of component. In this case, 马 can
also work as a _meaning_ component in many other characters, and in these
cases the meaning related to horses should be much more convincing than, say,
my made-up story for 玛. A couple of examples (still _phono-semantic_) of 马
as a _meaning_ component:

- The character 骑 (qí), which originally meant _to ride a horse_, but
later on extended its meaning to riding in general (horse, motorcycle, bike...).
Here, it makes sense that 马 provides the meaning, while the other component,
奇 (qí), provides the sound. _But wait, 奇 means 'weird, unusual'... No, no,
no, no, no, there is nothing weird about riding horses_. Remember, there's
no need to force meanings—it just provides the sound.
- The character 驴 (lǘ), which means _donkey_. Again, 马 provides the meaning
(a _donkey_ is similar to a _horse_), while 户 (hù, meaning 'door') provides
the sound. _Another witty joke?_ Okay, okay, no more jokes. Here 户 just gives
the sound. _But are hù and lǘ that similar sounds...?_ Well, you decide.
But do they really need to be? Not necessarily. How come? Bear with me—we'll go
back to this example in the next section.

The sharp reader may have noticed that when the character works as a meaning
component it appears on the left, and when it works as a sound component it
appears on the right. This is a nice observation, and is true most of the time,
so it can be used as a rule of thumb. However, always be careful because there
are also exceptions where this pattern doesn't hold.

The set of other characters where a specific character is used with the same
function is called a _series_. In the case of 马, if you're interested in
more examples, the (probably non-exhaustive) series are:

- The sound series: 吗 (ma), 妈 (mā), 玛 (mǎ), 码 (mǎ), 蚂 (mǎ), 骂 (mà).

- The semantic series: 骑, 驴, 验, 驻, 骗, 驱, 驶, 驾, 冯, 驳, 骤, 驰, 闯, 骚, 骄,
骇, 驼, 驯, 骆, 笃, 骏, 骡, 驭, 驮, 驹, 骁.

While the number of characters commonly used as meaning components is a rather
sane amount, the number of those used as sound components is I think way too
large. However, I don't recommend trying to memorize either sound or semantic
series of characters, since I think this is something you pick up naturally
while encountering the characters themselves, and I would instead focus
on learning the most common characters. For instance, from the sound and
semantic series for 马 presented above, I could probably identify the function
of 马 in them without knowing the actual character, and honestly, I don't even
know most of them, and it would be useless to try to do so just because they
happen to be in the same series.

At the end of the last section, I mentioned _Remembering the Hanzi_ as a
book that seemed to ignore the phonetic aspect of characters. Thanks to some
fellow learners, I also became aware of a similar book in Spanish by Pedro Ceinos
titled _Caracteres chinos_ (_Chinese characters_). This one actually does seem
to introduce phonetic components, trying to group the characters by their
_series_, but it always tries to enforce a meaning along with the sound.
In the book's introduction he explains this point of view, which he shares with
a few other scholars, that no sound component comes without a _slight_ hint of
additional meaning to the overall character, effectively saying that _almost_
all sound components are also meaning components at the same time. In addition,
even though he mentions the concept of _sound loan_, in the actual characters
where this happens he doesn't identify it, relying only on meaning-based
arguments.

While most scholars believe that sound loans and sound components can stand on
their own without adding any additional meaning—just like I tried to convey
here—I still think authors like Ceinos are laudable for their hard work.
He himself states that he's no linguist, and his book is a result of his
own experiences and beliefs, not necessarily aligned with other linguists'
point of view, which he is well aware of.

By now, I think you can't deny that characters _do speak_, and sound is a
crucial part of most of them. Unfortunately, you may still encounter some
tricky characters whose voices you will struggle to understand. Although this
can be quite challenging, we will devote the next section to at least try to
decipher some of them.

## I think I'm just a bit empty

In this article, I'm focusing on simplified Chinese characters, which are used
in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia, because that's what most foreign
learners start with, although I think experienced learners should know both
simplified and traditional scripts. For example, 馬 is the traditional _horse_,
while 马 is the simplified counterpart. Traditional characters are now mainly
used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Until the last century, they used to be a
single script with maybe some character variants. We won't try to address
[_why and when they changed_](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1012040) but
rather what they changed and how these changes affected the understanding of
the characters' etymology.

In the previous section, we saw 驴 (lǘ) as an example of a _phono-semantic_
character, where 户 (hù) gave the sound. While you could believe this works
as a sound hint, another person might argue they are quite different. While
in some cases the answer won't be too satisfying, in this case, it's quite
simple. The traditional version of 驴 is 驢, and it turns out that the
phonetic component's (盧) sound is lú, which seems much more accurate.
What happened here?

Enter the world of _empty_ components.

When characters are simplified in one way or another, we're doomed to lose
some important information about them. In the previous example, the simplified
component 户 can be known as both an _empty_ component and a _sound_ component.
When simplifying characters, there are a few ways to do it. In this case, 户
doesn't look excessively similar to 盧, nor does its sound, but together
they somehow work as a simplified alternative. It can be called _empty_ because
it lost its original form, although it can also still be called a _sound_
component because it still conveys a small sound hint. Simplifying characters
often comes at a small cost—they become harder to understand logically.

Other times, however, the simplified character works quite well without
losing any significant parts. Let's have a look at 认 (rèn), which can mean
_to know_ (part of the common compound 认识, rènshi, _to know_), and whose
traditional character is 認.

- The _meaning_ component is 讠, which is the simplified version of 訁, meaning
_speech_ or something related to _speech_, giving the overall meaning _to
recognize, to admit, to know_. One of the common simplification techniques is
the regularization of cursive script. In fact, our lovely 马 also comes from
a cursive variant! In some cases, this may still look similar to the original
character and thus not be considered an _empty_ component. Additionally, this
simplification of some characters is consistent and always used this way when
it works as a component in other characters.
- The _sound_ component is 人 (rén), which is totally not a reasonable
simplification of 忍 (rěn) when it comes to its form, and can thus be considered
an _empty_ component. But keep in mind that its function was only as a sound
hint, and the simplified alternative also does this pretty well, so it's still
a perfect sound component in the simplified character. We couldn't ask for more.
Also, remember that it's fine for characters to work as either meaning or sound
components, so in this case, just because 人 (meaning person) is almost always
a meaning component (written as 亻) when part of other characters, you don't
need to force a meaning, it can also just work as a sound component.

Was that okay? Well, now for the real mess... A character that often appears
as an _empty_ component in simplified characters is 又 (yòu), which would by
itself be a depiction of a _right hand_, and looks something more similar to
ㄡ when used as a component on the left side. Let's see some examples in
characters that may be familiar even to inexperienced Chinese learners:

- The character 汉 (hàn), which can now reference the Han ethnic group, and is
also part of the word 汉字 (hànzi), which means _Chinese character_. The 又 is
an empty component and used to be the sound component 𦰩 (jiān) for the
traditional variant 漢.
- The character 难 (nán), which now means _difficult_ just by pure _sound loan_.
However, before that, its original meaning was a type of bird, with 又 being
an _empty_ component, simplification of 𦰩 (jiān) from the traditional variant
難. What? The same one as for 汉? Then it's always like this? _Ha!_ Not even
close... Just wait and see the next ones.
- The character 对 (duì), which now means _yes_ or _to face_, among other
things. Here the 又 is an _empty_ component, simplification of 丵 and 土 in 對.
It used to represent something related to developing the land, certainly not
a sound component, maybe later a _sound loan_, but well, I won't even try
to explain this one because I don't even get it myself.
- The character 欢 (huān), which can mean _happy_. Here the 又 is—you guessed
it—an _empty_ component, simplification of 雚 (guàn), a sound component in
_the_ traditional... What? Well, somehow there are _four_ different variants
in the traditional script—歡, 驩, 懽, 讙. At least the sound component is the
same in all of them...
- The character 观 (guān), which means _to observe_. Your good friend 又 is yet
again here trying to hide another sound component, this one again being 雚
(guàn), from the traditional variant 觀.
- The character 鸡 (jī), which means _chicken_. You obviously know what
function 又 plays, and it used to be 奚 (xī), a sound component for the two
different variants 鷄 and 雞 of the traditional script.

Phew! That really was a mess... And believe me there are like ten more
characters where 又 is an _empty_ component. When confronted with these
difficulties, one could only think that maybe traditional characters are not
that hard, since their components are _completely_ more consistent.

Another unfortunate example of _empty_ component can be found in 续 (xù),
which can mean _to continue_. Here, 卖 (mài) is supposed to be the sound
component. Well, this doesn't sound quite similar... Its traditional form
is 賣. It turns out that this is accurate for the single character 卖, but
for our original one 续/續, the component 賣 was actually a simplification
of 𧶠[^8] (you'd better _zoom_ your screen if you can't tell the difference),
which is pronounced yù (much more similar to xù). Therefore, the sound component
was quite accurate at some point in the past but turned into an _empty_
component when it was simplified to the unrelated 賣, leaving us apparently
with two different sounds for the same character. But now you know the reason.

:::::

We're bringing the third act to a close, but there's still one thing I want
to talk about. In the first sentence of the article, I mentioned that characters
can produce _utterances of Old Chinese understood only by scholars_. Although
not directly related to _empty_ components, this phenomenon can also disguise
the real intentions, just like _empty_ components do. I will try to explain
what I meant with another example.

Consider the character 也 (yě), which can now be used by _sound loan_ to mean
_also_ or can be used as a particle[^6]. The following is, again, a
non-exhaustive list of its sound series: 他 (tā), 她 (tā), 牠 (tā), 地 (dì),
施 (shī), 池 (chí), 驰 (chí), 弛 (chí), 㐌 (yí), 匜 (yí). _What?_ There are at
least five different sounds here! What's going on? Well, as almost always, the
explanation can be quite simple, although not too satisfying. 

You see, the sounds I showed you are the evolved modern sounds used in Mandarin
for those characters. Thousands of years have passed, and spoken language
evolves, so in the past, all of them would have had a similar sound, but they
evolved into quite different sounds as time passed. For instance, some of them
in Old Chinese are transcribed as *l̥ʰaːl, *l'els, *hljal, *l'aːl, *l'al, *hljalʔ,
*lal. _No, no, no, I'm not an expert in Old Chinese_. I just though you would
like to see the transcriptions yourself
([see this phonetic series table](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9F#Chinese)).
Unless we happen to be linguists ourselves, trained in the recognition of
sound evolutions, this can just be a pain, but the only workaround is to
acknowledge that these characters now have multiple voices, and we should
take all of them into account. In the end, I guess we should just trust
phonologists on this one.

## What a beautiful recital!

By now, I just hope I didn't disappoint you when I claimed that Chinese
characters can _speak_. I will be satisfied if I helped you train your ear
just a tiny bit so that next time you encounter a character _in the wild_,
you'll have a higher chance of deciphering its voice. Let's review what we
learned here.

- The _sound loan_ phenomenon. Sometimes characters are borrowed just for
their sound, as simple as that. They had an original meaning but it started
being substituted by another one whose spoken word sounded the same, perhaps
because it was too abstract of a concept to build a real pictogram for.
Example: 四 (sì), originally _to exhale_, but now _four_ (sì), because it had
the same sound.
- The _phono-semantic_ compound. Roughly 80% of Chinese characters are built
from two blocks: a _meaning_ component, which gives a small hint for its meaning,
and a _sound_ component, which gives a small hint for how it's read. Example:
妈 (mā), from 女 (woman), _meaning_ component, and 马 (mǎ), _sound_ component.
- The _empty_ component. Sometimes a component undergoes a simplification
process that loses the clearer sight of its function in the character, usually
conveying misleading information (mostly about its sound). Example: the
excessively large number of unrelated components that 又 simplifies,
like 汉, 难, 对, 欢, 观, 鸡, etc.

You're now closer to becoming the conductor of the characters' orchestra!

It was never my intention to make you think that learning and understanding
Chinese characters is _easy_. Again, I still remember many years ago when I
would immerse myself in playful stories and crafty mnemonics, with the sole
purpose of getting my brain to remember a bit of these Japanese characters,
which for some reason the Japanese thought it was a good idea to borrow from
the Chinese hundreds of years ago. But at some point, I quit Heisig's method
out of pure boredom. I just wanted to _read_.

I started changing my strategy when I met etymology—_real_ etymology.
Although there were still some parts of the puzzle that I couldn't put
together at times, overall, the process of understanding the characters became
increasingly clear. I was really starting to hear (and enjoy) the characters'
voices to the point that they would end up feeling like a real alphabet—not
much different from a Latin alphabet (_ok, ok, just a few thousand more
symbols_), but still a millennia-old script system that initially built itself
on the pretense of pictographic roots yet eventually kept growing
systematically out of the need to represent abstract and complex concepts that
would otherwise prove impossible without stealing some voices from here or
there, recycling some characters all over again, building their own monumental
_hieroglyphs_, inducing false fantasies in the marveled Westerners whose eyes
dreamed of _intellectual paintings_, _metaphysical and ideal pictorial algebras
of the sciences and arts_[^9], but still, down to its core, just another way
to convey the power and beauty of language.

## Bonus: Character etymology resources

_Pssst, the show is over..._. If you keep reading this, I'm assuming I somehow
caught your attention and you're interested in knowing more about Chinese
character etymology. After this long journey, I wouldn't want you to conclude
that I wrote the whole thing just as a shameless advertisement. This post was
born for three main reasons:

- I barely ever write. But I wanted to give it a try. I just wanted to convey
my interests in one topic and make an attempt at some serious writing. I can
now say I enjoyed the process, and I hope I'll keep writing in the future.
- I _really_ got into _real_ etymology when stumbling upon
[Outlier linguistics](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/). _Yeah, yeah, this
is a paid service, blah, blah, blah_. Since it has been so useful to me, I also
wanted to present it briefly here but not in the main article, lest it would
feel like I'm trying to sell you something. If you're curious and willing to
spend a bit of money, maybe you could also read the second subsection.
- Once I got to grasp the characters' voices myself, and also being aware of
many people who still haven't, I just wanted to put my two cents here and link
them to this so that they could widen their vision a little bit.

Let's go to the resources!

### I'm not into pay-to-win, there's plenty of free stuff on the internet

_Yes, you're right!_ I'm also fond of free resources, particularly when you're
a student and can't afford any paid alternatives. I have some interesting
ones for you that I also use from time to time:

- [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page): I wasn't
paying too much attention to it in the past, but believe me, I used it _a lot_
when writing this article. When looking at entries for Chinese characters, I
mainly use the section called _Glyph origin_, which is where you can find
information like the one I present here. Look, for example, at 
[this entry for 四](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B), that I used to
get some info for our _sound loan_ introduction. 
There are probably not too many places with such a varied knowledge yet still
detailed and quite accurate.
- [Hanziyuan](https://hanziyuan.net/#home): From 汉字源 (hànziyuán), meaning
_source of Chinese characters_. This is a lifelong project by Richard Sears,
popularly known as _Uncle hanzi_ in China. He presents an astounding database
of different versions of each character throughout history to see their
evolution, along with additional data about the character, some related to
its etymology and decomposition, though this information can sometimes feel
a bit _cryptic_. The site can feel a bit old, but it's still incredibly relevant.
On the main page, there are also a few articles linked, but the links are broken.
You can access them
[here](https://github.com/Dixin/Etymology/blob/main/docs/_posts/2017-09-17-why-study-chinese-etymology.md).
These are also an invaluable resource to get started in etymology and might
also contain some additional explanations to better understand the sometimes
_cryptic_ information found on the site.
- [Dong Chinese dictionary](https://www.dong-chinese.com/dictionary): Okay, I
must confess I haven't used this one myself a lot, but probably because I
only found it recently. I had a look at some dictionary entries and the origin
explanations seem accurate. For instance, 
[the entry for 四](https://www.dong-chinese.com/dictionary/search/%E5%9B%9B)
is also in line with what we explained. It seems they take the origins
seriously, as I read through 
[this brief post](https://blog.dong-chinese.com/2019/07/07/character-origins.html).
Incidentally, they also mention a resource I wasn't aware of, which they
describe as _The most reliable and comprehensive source for character origins
available online that I’ve found_. I'll include it here as well, [again with
our example for 四
](https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/search.php?word=%E5%9B%9B).
That one is only in Chinese—fortunately, we live in a time when we can use
tools like ChatGPT for accurate translations, so that shouldn't be a problem.
- [Zhongwen](https://zhongwen.com/): When talking about Chinese characters
etymology, it's impossible not to mention the _Shuowen Jiezi_, a character
dictionary compiled by Xu Shen by the year 100 CE, which continues to be a
relevant source to this day, even though some of its character explanations
may now be considered outdated due to more recent research. Many tools try to
break down characters into _radicals_, but doing so automatically usually
results in a _horrible_ and _meaningless_ decomposition. On this site, you
can navigate through a tree containing all characters and their inclusion
relations as compiled manually by the _Shuowen Jiezi_. Each entry also
contains a little explanation from the book itself and vocabulary examples.
Keep in mind that the general tree is presented in traditional script, but the
simplified version is also shown for each entry. Also, remember this is faithful
to the _Shuowen Jiezi_, so some explanations may be outdated.
- [Shuowenjiezi](http://www.shuowenjiezi.com/): _Tired of seeing short
explanations from others that have read the Shuowen Jiezi for you? Then why
not read it yourself?_ Okay, this is a hardcore resource. Here, you can
access the entire _Shuowen Jiezi_ in Chinese, along with commentaries from
Duan Yucai's annotated edition from 1815 and many other sources. You must
_really_ like etymology if you end up here. Again, if you don't speak
Chinese, you can just translate, not a big deal. Another thing that I find
awesome (and I value in any dictionary) is that you can click any character
in the text and it directly goes to the entry for that character. A
_paradise_ for linguists and etymology _enthusiasts_.

Let's acknowledge and appreciate the immense effort that so many people
have put into compiling these resources and offering them for free. The
world is a better place thanks to people like them.

### I value my time, take my money and give me the etymology

After presenting such a useful list of free resources above, what are we left
with? Can anything be better than that? Well, it depends on what you consider
_better_. From those resources, apart from the _Dong Chinese dictionary_ and,
to a lesser extent, the _Hanziyuan_ and the _Zhongwen_ ones, in general, we can
assume the vast majority of reliable etymology resources are not focused on
Chinese learners, but rather on academia and research itself. Therefore, a Chinese
language student might find them overwhelming (I'm aware you might have also
felt like that when reading some parts of my article, and I'm sorry for that).

As much as I find all of this interesting, you would have a point if you said
most of the information is quite unhelpful for learning the language.
Unfortunately, I don't remember when and how this happened, but at some point
while I was learning Japanese I stumbled upon
[Outlier linguistics](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/).
I found myself watching their [_How Chinese characters actually work_ playlist
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng3UC894haQ&list=PLebp9ufr_vijeQBbjFo7YHI6RaibrYFMI)
and found it enlightening. Then I also read through some of their posts
(the equivalents for Japanese, but I'm linking the ones for Chinese here),
notably these—[_part 1_](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/blogs/chinese/what-is-etymology-and-is-it-useful-for-learning-chinese-characters-part-1)
and [_part 2_](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/blogs/chinese/what-is-etymology-and-is-it-useful-for-learning-chinese-characters-part-2)
(they have more nice free-to-read posts there if you're interested).

The team at _Outlier linguistics_ is made up of two
people—[Ash Henson](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/pages/ash), who has
a PhD touching many fields of Chinese linguistics, and 
[John Renfroe](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/pages/john), who
basically got into Sinology by accident but none could stop him until he
found himself researching in classical Chinese, Chinese paleography,
history and archaeology. Surely this pair must know something about Chinese
character origins.

These two put their efforts into building a reliable dictionary of Chinese
character etymology, keeping up to date with research, and trying to provide
only the information necessary for Chinese learners to understand how the
characters form, without necessarily going into too much detail. I found this
systematic approach extremely convenient when I would be reading some text
and want to know about an unfamiliar character. I can basically do it in
less than 30 seconds from my phone (it integrates with the
[Pleco app](https://www.pleco.com/)).

If you believe you can pay back for a service that makes your life easier and
you can afford it, I would highly recommend 
[_The Outlier Dictionary of Chinese Characters_](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/products/outlier-dictionary-of-chinese-characters)
(the _Essentials edition_). The _Expert edition_ contains much more information
in the spirit of the more detailed research resources I presented before, but
since this is also a lot of work to do, for now, they only have this extra
information for a subset of the characters. In any case, an amazing feature is
that, even in the _Essentials edition_, they include at least one reference
to a technical book as a source for their claims, making it extremely reliable,
and you can use that as a starting point if you really want to delve deeper.
For learners, though, the _Essentials edition_ is enough, just consider the
_Expert edition_ if you use the _Essentials_ and you absolutely love it.

From everything I presented, this is the resource I use the most without a
doubt, and I also used it for some of the information included in this article
(trying not to abuse it too much and also draw from open resources), so
I hope the authors can forgive me by having devoted a whole subsection to their
amazing dictionary. I won't try to explain anything else; they already do it
a hundred times better than me.

Lastly, for those of you learning Chinese, if you accept a little advice from
another fellow learner, _just go and read_. Use all these resources just as a
helpful secondary tool. Only access them when you find characters you don't
know. Don't lose time trying to memorize words, or worse, individual characters.
The best way to remember a word or character is through the frustration of not
having been able to understand it in its context. And if you don't understand
the sentence, fear not! Tell _ChatGPT_ to break it down and explain grammar
points. You will grasp them in no time. _Just go and read_.
Personally, I love _graded readers_. You can see some recommendations
[here](https://lahlahbanana.com/2022/04/27/chinese-graded-novels-readers-review/)
(I'm particularly fond of the _Chinese breeze_ series) and also learn more about
[_extensive reading_](https://lahlahbanana.com/2021/08/28/extensive-reading-the-secret-to-learning-chinese/).

Enjoy the journey.

[^1]: There is a subtle difference in wording here. First, characters
    like 一, 二 and 三 should be called _ideograms_, since they represent
    abstract _ideas_ rather than _pictures_ of real things. The other
    examples, however, should be called _pictograms_. While the terms
    _pictogram_ and _pictograph_ are sometimes used interchangeably,
    I would argue that _pictograph_ is more precise when referring to
    ancient historical representations like cave paintings. In contrast,
    _pictogram_ should be more appropriate when discussing characters
    within a writing system.

[^2]: I've heard this explanation many times, and while it might seem
    reasonable, early depictions in texts suggest otherwise. The pictogram
    appears to more closely resemble a human figure with breasts, either
    kneeling or standing—not sitting with crossed legs. In that case, the
    inferred gender would be better explained by the presence of breasts,
    which would likely be a more convincing argument for our _confused_
    student.

[^3]: If you still didn't know the characters and tried to guess them,
    you can check a table of the numbers 
    [here](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n9LKmfe5nJiBcBu7QjXOKXetWHs9UQ9YKVK43pYx94fKP3lr0Xs6GSa5lkwN86vJ4NAOPmM2AgOkEIUWnmF9u9oIMFrRWI4Tgh7791gpCQppmmvlkJQCEYHQohU_ZkRRNHuykiQiQIdsvI1Wx7Bp-Hs).
    If you're interested in knowing a bit more about the numbers,
    [this article](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Chinese_numerals/)
    is quite interesting.

[^4]: This is one chapter from _The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy_ by
    John DeFrancis, who seems to be controversial at times. I can't tell you
    why, since I have only read this specific chapter, so I can't speak for
    the rest, but at least this one I found quite inspiring.

[^5]: The meaning actually comes as an abbreviation of 玛瑙 (mǎnǎo), from an
    earlier form, 马脑, which seems to be a mistranslation from Sanskrit,
    mistakenly understood as _horse's brain_. So while originally even the
    horse part could have an explanation, here we only focus on the modern
    character. See the 
    [Wiktionary entry](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%91%AA%E7%91%99#Chinese) 
    for more details.

[^6]: For the reader not familiar with particles, just think of them as
    characters without a real concrete meaning, which are used to give a
    sentence or a part of it a certain function or emotion.

[^7]: For the reader not familiar with tones, just keep in mind that the
    sound (_what you say_) is the same, but the intonation (_how you say it_)
    can be different. In Mandarin _pinyin_ (the romanization of Chinese
    characters) we denote the intonations with different marks on the vowels.

[^8]: This character is itself a simplification. Initially I wanted to show
    here the absolute _beast_ that is the older character 𧸇, but most likely
    you can't see it in your device unless you have a special font installed
    that supports old characters. It's not your fault. If you can't see the
    one in this footnote, you can get an idea of how it looks like in the
    images I included.

[^9]: Metaphors from an excerpt of _Mémoires concernant l'histoire, les
    sciences, les arts, les moeurs, les usages, &c des Chinois, par les
    missionaries de Pekin_, which I read in the article 
    [_The ideographic myth_](https://pinyin.info/readings/texts/ideographic_myth.html).
